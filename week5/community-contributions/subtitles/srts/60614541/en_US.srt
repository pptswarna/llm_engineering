I am delighted to welcome you to the first day of our eight weeks together as you join me on this adventure

00:07.610 --> 00:11.120
to master AI and LLM engineering.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.560
Now look, it's customary in these things to start with me giving an introduction about myself.

00:15.590 --> 00:16.520
Tell you about the course.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.380
Tell you what you all accomplish over eight weeks.

00:18.410 --> 00:19.700
ET cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.650
But no, this isn't that kind.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.090
Of course it's not what I'm going to do.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.340
We have plenty of time to get back to that later.

00:25.340 --> 00:30.380
What we're going to do now is get right into the thick of it and get you set up and using an LLM on

00:30.380 --> 00:33.710
your computer right away for a useful purpose.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.520
So without further ado, go on to the next video and I'll get you set up.
