00:00.920 --> 00:03.530
Well, another congratulations moment.

00:03.530 --> 00:13.010
You have 40% on the way to being an LM engineer at a high level of proficiency at this point, in addition

00:13.010 --> 00:19.340
to the stuff that you you know very well about frontier models and open source models, you can also

00:19.340 --> 00:28.160
now use the Hugging Face open LM leaderboard to compare different models against a number of hard metrics,

00:28.160 --> 00:34.010
and you've got a great understanding of the difference between these metrics, what they score and why,

00:34.010 --> 00:36.620
and the limitations of the metrics as well.

00:36.650 --> 00:42.860
Hopefully you spent some quality time yourself now with the LM leaderboard, getting familiar with the

00:42.860 --> 00:44.060
different models.

00:44.270 --> 00:47.480
Next week there is some more on leaderboards to do.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.050
I hope you're not bored of leaderboards yet, because we're going to look at a bunch of others that

00:51.050 --> 00:57.560
are used to compare more specialized things about models, and we're also going to look at ones that

00:57.560 --> 01:01.910
bring together open source and closed source, which will be very interesting.

01:02.330 --> 01:08.390
We are going to talk about real world use cases of LM solving commercial problems.

01:08.390 --> 01:16.220
I imagine everyone has experienced this in your workplace and in just using products all the time.

01:16.220 --> 01:22.430
But I want to go through a few examples and have you think about other places where Llms have been applied

01:22.460 --> 01:29.300
to solve hard commercial problems beyond the obvious, and that should equip you to be able to confidently

01:29.300 --> 01:36.530
choose the right LM for your task at hand, so that you know when you're facing a commercial project,

01:36.560 --> 01:43.670
how do you go about navigating the huge number of possible models and select the right couple to build

01:43.670 --> 01:44.690
a prototype for?

01:44.690 --> 01:47.060
So with that, I will see you next time.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.110
We've got lots to do.
