00:00.920 --> 00:04.850
So we've covered steps 1 to 4 of the five step strategy.

00:04.850 --> 00:10.010
And that brings us to step five, which is productionize the one that maybe you haven't thought as much

00:10.010 --> 00:11.240
about to date.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.520
And this is about saying we built our model.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.250
It's time for prime time.

00:16.730 --> 00:23.810
We typically will start by defining an API that can be used to call our model to call our code.

00:23.810 --> 00:32.570
That itself is either using a open source model or making a call to a frontier model with with various

00:32.780 --> 00:36.680
scaffolding around it, like rag or prompt engineering.

00:37.190 --> 00:42.500
We then decide how are we going to host and deploy our model, our API.

00:42.530 --> 00:48.410
We address things like how it's going to be monitored, the information security concerns, how will

00:48.410 --> 00:49.580
it scale up?

00:49.730 --> 00:56.750
We then measure the business metrics that we had identified all the way back in step one and continuously

00:56.750 --> 01:02.390
retrain, measure performance, and improve our model on an ongoing basis.

01:02.420 --> 01:06.320
These are all part of the Productionize activity.

01:07.820 --> 01:14.660
And so with that, where are we in our business problem that we've taken on to predict product prices.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.600
So the first step understand we've done it.

01:17.630 --> 01:18.410
We understood it.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.850
We've talked about metrics.

01:19.850 --> 01:21.170
We know what we've got to do.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.900
Preparation is what we're doing right now.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.630
We are in the middle of preparing our data set.

01:26.630 --> 01:30.290
And then we need to select our model or models.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.300
We need to customize.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.060
And then finally we need to productionize.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.060
So we will be going through all of those steps.

01:38.150 --> 01:43.400
But we will be first of all finishing the second step preparation.

01:43.400 --> 01:49.520
And with that let's go right now back to JupyterLab and get to preparing.
