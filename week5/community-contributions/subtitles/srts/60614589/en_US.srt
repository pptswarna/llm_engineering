00:00.500 --> 00:07.280
So we're now going to run a large language model directly on your box using a platform called llama,

00:07.280 --> 00:14.330
which lets you run C plus plus code version of Llms compiled directly on your machine.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.810
I'm going to start by showing you on windows, and then we'll flip over to Mac.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.560
So to start with llama you bring up your favorite browser.

00:21.590 --> 00:22.880
Let's go to Microsoft Edge.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.950
And you can simply go to llama.

00:24.980 --> 00:31.310
Com or just search llama llama it's O followed by llama.

00:31.820 --> 00:35.660
And the first hit here in the search results will be Alarm.com.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.650
And here it is.

00:36.680 --> 00:42.230
It's called llama because it was initially built around a model that's called llama, which is the open

00:42.230 --> 00:47.480
source model from meta, which really stole the show a couple of years ago when it first came out.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.230
So downloading is as simple as pressing the download button.

00:51.230 --> 00:56.210
And once you press the download button, you press download for windows and it will start to download

00:56.210 --> 00:57.740
the windows version.

00:57.950 --> 01:02.930
And if I look here at my downloads, I will see that it has downloaded.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.380
There's a Setup.exe.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.530
If I press the open file button, it will prompt me.

01:07.530 --> 01:08.100
Oh, it's still.

01:08.130 --> 01:09.000
It's still downloading again.

01:09.030 --> 01:09.630
I just ran this.

01:09.660 --> 01:15.240
It will prompt me to install it locally, which I will do as soon as it's installed locally.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.060
You then go to the start menu and you're probably familiar with this, but you bring up a PowerShell

01:21.090 --> 01:27.630
by typing power in here, and as soon as you do, it prompts you and you press open and up comes a PowerShell,

01:27.630 --> 01:31.920
which is where we are going right now to run a large language model.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.780
Minutes into this course and the way we do it is we simply type once.

01:36.810 --> 01:44.280
Once that install is completed and you pressed okay, you can just simply say olama o l l a m a run.

01:44.280 --> 01:49.290
And now you put the name of the model next, and the name of the model we're going to use is going to

01:49.290 --> 01:55.020
be llama 3.2, which is one of the very newest models.

01:55.860 --> 01:57.060
And so here it goes.

01:57.060 --> 01:58.020
And it's run.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.400
It's happening right now.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.060
That blinking cursor means that we have a large language model running on this computer.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.770
It might take a bit longer for you the first time.

02:04.770 --> 02:10.210
It has to download the 2 billion parameters associated with Lama, and depending on your internet connection,

02:10.210 --> 02:13.870
that might take a little bit, but you'll get a progress bar that will show you what's going on.

02:14.230 --> 02:18.460
So what we're now going to do is try and talk to this LLM, and we're going to try and do something

02:18.460 --> 02:20.020
useful with a free LLM.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.250
And here's what we'll do.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.620
I'm actually trying to learn Spanish at the moment.

02:23.620 --> 02:28.630
And I can tell you that my grasp of the Spanish language is distinctly less inferior to my grasp of

02:28.630 --> 02:29.350
llms.

02:29.710 --> 02:36.730
And the app that I'm using to try and teach me has a service where you can pay to chat with a with an

02:36.730 --> 02:37.720
AI tutor.

02:37.750 --> 02:42.370
Now, I don't want to pay for that because I know I can run an open source model and do it for free.

02:42.370 --> 02:48.130
So right now we're going to build ourselves a Spanish tutor which will teach me Spanish.

02:48.490 --> 02:51.400
All open source without paying a penny.

02:51.400 --> 02:57.460
So I'm going to say I am trying to learn Spanish.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.960
I am a complete beginner.

03:04.690 --> 03:12.000
Please chat with me in basic Spanish to teach me.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.630
And so that is the prompt that we will start with.

03:15.630 --> 03:16.830
And let's see what happens.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.820
It's thinking.

03:18.390 --> 03:19.230
Hola.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.480
Welcome to our conversation in Spanish.

03:21.510 --> 03:24.570
To start, let's begin with some basic greetings.

03:24.630 --> 03:25.800
Como estas?

03:26.250 --> 03:30.540
So you can see that it's giving me a very good starting prompt.

03:30.540 --> 03:31.890
It's giving me some examples.

03:31.890 --> 03:33.930
It understands where I'm coming from.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.240
And I can now say something like.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.120
Put an accent on.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.550
Uh, so.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.410
Oh, there's a small mistake.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.050
Okay, there we go.

03:52.050 --> 03:52.710
It's correcting me.

03:52.710 --> 03:58.320
I think it's the accent that I missed and maybe the question mark as well, so you get the idea.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.870
We've actually just built something which has commercial value because indeed, this is sold at a price

04:03.870 --> 04:11.790
immediately for free on our boxes using an open source LLM that is llms in action from the get go.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.700
And now for Mac people, let's flip over to a mac.
