00:00.590 --> 00:04.460
Well, congratulations on leveling up yet again.

00:04.520 --> 00:08.690
You've got some real hard skills that you've added to your arsenal.

00:08.750 --> 00:14.570
Uh, it's, uh, been a really, really enjoyable last few lectures.

00:14.570 --> 00:20.990
So at this point, not only can you confidently use OpenAI's API, not only can you throw Anthropic

00:20.990 --> 00:25.970
and Gemini into the mix, but you can also build UIs for your solution.

00:25.970 --> 00:32.660
Doing reasonably sophisticated things like pick between models and make changes to prompts, and generate

00:32.660 --> 00:35.750
company brochures with markdown and streaming.

00:35.810 --> 00:41.630
Uh, it's all pretty, uh, high functionality stuff, so well done.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.650
Tomorrow, though, uh, we raised the bar again.

00:45.650 --> 00:53.090
We'll be able to build chat UIs in Gradio, so these are more complex UIs with much more going on with

00:53.120 --> 00:55.880
like, an instant message style interaction.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.740
It sounds complex.

00:57.770 --> 00:58.850
We'll see if it is.

00:59.060 --> 01:05.900
Uh, we're going to talk about providing more context in a prompt, including Multi-shot prompting something

01:05.900 --> 01:10.160
which hopefully you already experimented with a bit in some of the earlier exercises, and we'll keep

01:10.160 --> 01:11.420
going with that.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.010
And ultimately we're going to build a customer support assistant.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.460
We're going to build a real tool and see how that works.

01:19.460 --> 01:22.490
And that's all happening starting in the next lecture.

01:22.490 --> 01:23.510
And I'll see you there.
