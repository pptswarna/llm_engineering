00:00.410 --> 00:06.830
So how does it feel to be 30% of the way down the journey to being a proficient LLM engineer?

00:06.860 --> 00:12.020
Take a moment to congratulate yourself on a big accomplishment and a lot of progress.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.850
And hopefully you have that sense.

00:13.850 --> 00:19.310
You have that feeling that you are up skilling, that you can do so much more than you could just a

00:19.310 --> 00:22.160
matter of days ago, and it's going to keep being that way.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.120
We're going to keep building and building on the skills and knowledge that you're acquiring.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.790
So you're able to do more and more.

00:28.820 --> 00:32.780
But again, what you can already do, you can already confidently code with frontiers.

00:32.780 --> 00:36.410
You can build multimodal AI assistants using tools.

00:36.410 --> 00:40.670
And now and now you're familiar with hugging face pipelines.

00:40.670 --> 00:49.310
And you can use pipelines to run inference tasks across a wide variety of different common machine learning

00:49.340 --> 00:50.390
tasks.

00:50.840 --> 01:00.620
Next time, next time we get below into the lower level Transformers API as we start to work with Tokenizers,

01:00.650 --> 01:05.690
we've of course already spent some time talking about tokens, and we looked at Gpts tokenizer through

01:05.690 --> 01:06.800
the web user interface.

01:06.830 --> 01:13.190
Now we're going to actually use code to translate text to tokens and back again.

01:13.190 --> 01:16.550
And as part of that we're going to understand things like special tokens.

01:16.550 --> 01:22.550
I remember I had a sidebar, uh, ramble about some time ago now, but it's going to all come together.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.450
It's going to be worth it.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.060
That seed I planted is going to come together.

01:26.060 --> 01:31.070
When we look at what tokens look like for what gets passed into an LLM.

01:31.070 --> 01:37.610
And then also when we look at these things called chat templates, all of this is going to be extremely

01:37.610 --> 01:41.660
important foundation material, and I look forward to going through it with you next time.
