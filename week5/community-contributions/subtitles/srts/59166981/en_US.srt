00:00.980 --> 00:04.040
Welcome to week two, day five.

00:04.070 --> 00:09.050
The last day of week two where a lot is coming together.

00:09.050 --> 00:16.100
I am so grateful that you're sticking with it, and I'm going to make it worth your while because today

00:16.100 --> 00:18.620
is going to be really, really good fun.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.530
I'm excited to get into this.

00:21.890 --> 00:24.410
It's the big conclusion of the second week.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.800
Again, I'm going to keep saying what you can do.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.840
I think it's so important to celebrate your upskilling, you know, Transformers back to front.

00:32.840 --> 00:38.660
You can code against the frontier APIs, you can build an AI assistant, and you can add tools to give

00:38.660 --> 00:39.800
it expertise.

00:39.830 --> 00:42.440
Today we introduce agents.

00:42.440 --> 00:48.650
We talk about how agents can carry out more advanced sequential activities.

00:48.650 --> 00:56.450
And then we do something super fun creating a multimodal AI assistant using agents and tools.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.390
So what are agents?

00:59.720 --> 01:01.190
Agents, I should say.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.390
An agent I.

01:02.420 --> 01:02.900
An agent.

01:03.530 --> 01:07.790
It is one of these umbrella terms that people can use in different contexts.

01:07.790 --> 01:12.140
So it is one of these things that, that that can mean different things to different people.

01:12.140 --> 01:17.660
But generally speaking, most often people are talking about software entities that are autonomous.

01:17.660 --> 01:25.640
They can perform tasks not just in the sense of taking an input prompt and generating text.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.530
Um, typical characteristics.

01:27.530 --> 01:28.700
Let's say they are autonomous.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.740
They have some sort of agency, they are goal oriented, that they have some kind of thing that they're

01:33.740 --> 01:37.520
setting out to do, and that they are task specific.

01:37.520 --> 01:42.620
They are usually specialized on being good at one thing or another.

01:43.010 --> 01:48.230
Um, and they're typically designed to be part of something called an agent framework, which is a sort

01:48.230 --> 01:55.190
of environment in which agents can interact to solve more complex problems and potentially with limited

01:55.190 --> 01:56.450
human involvement.

01:56.450 --> 02:00.020
So it's not like it's just a sort of request response situation with a human.

02:00.020 --> 02:06.150
But you can imagine this sort of environment where multiple software agents that could be combinations

02:06.150 --> 02:12.690
of llms along with traditional software interacting in order to carry out tasks.

02:12.690 --> 02:19.770
And so some of the features you might expect is the ability to have memory or persistence that sort

02:19.770 --> 02:26.820
of goes beyond just a request response, the ability to have some sort of decision making and orchestration

02:26.820 --> 02:30.750
about what does what are planning abilities.

02:30.930 --> 02:36.240
And sometimes that is just a matter of the environment as some planning coded into it.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.410
Sometimes you have an LLM which is responsible for planning.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.840
It's a model that knows how to take complex problems and break it down into smaller problems for other

02:45.840 --> 02:47.400
models to take care of.

02:47.880 --> 02:53.310
And then use of tools is often also an example of a genetic AI.

02:53.310 --> 02:59.370
This is where, of course, as you are now very familiar, we give models the ability to do things like

02:59.370 --> 03:06.910
connect to databases or connect to the internet or whatever we want because we are providing it access

03:06.910 --> 03:10.450
to functions and we know how that works behind under the hood.

03:10.450 --> 03:17.440
Now we know that it's really just a fancy if statement, but it gives the effect that the Llms are able

03:17.440 --> 03:18.580
to do this.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.540
So we're about to do a few things.

03:22.540 --> 03:26.170
Let me just quickly sort of set the scene for you.

03:26.200 --> 03:34.390
We're going to first build a function that can generate images, a good multimodal use case.

03:34.390 --> 03:37.990
We're going to have an LLM call that can do that.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.760
And it's going to be a function that does it.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.670
And you can think of that in its own right as being like an agent.

03:42.670 --> 03:49.000
It's like a piece of software that is able to take this very specific, specialized instruction and

03:49.000 --> 03:49.540
do it.

03:49.540 --> 03:58.990
That will be an artist that we will create in code with the help of Dall-E three, the the image generation

03:58.990 --> 04:02.240
model from uh, OpenAI.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.910
Uh, and, you know, if you want to to quibble, you could argue that image generation is not in itself

04:07.910 --> 04:09.650
an LM thing.

04:09.680 --> 04:16.250
Uh, lm being language models, but these days, generally llms are used interchangeably with the broader

04:16.250 --> 04:18.380
gen AI context.

04:18.380 --> 04:24.590
And so one does tend to think of image generation and other kinds of multimodal generation as falling

04:24.590 --> 04:28.100
within the LM engineer's, uh, toolkit.

04:29.120 --> 04:35.510
So we're then going to look to, to make agents these sort of, uh, these, these functions that are

04:35.510 --> 04:36.290
able to do things.

04:36.290 --> 04:43.700
And we're going to add sound as well as images, and then we're going to have an agent framework in

04:43.730 --> 04:50.000
that we are going to teach our AI assistant, the same airline assistant that we've been working on

04:50.030 --> 04:52.580
how to speak and draw.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.820
All right, without further ado, I hope that sounds fun to you.

04:55.850 --> 04:59.060
I hope it sounds exciting because it's going to be it's going to be great.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.320
Uh, I can't wait to do it.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.700
Let's go and do it right now.
