WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:06.620
And now let's move to Claude from anthropic, my favorite model and typically the favorite model of

00:06.620 --> 00:08.120
most data scientists.

00:08.120 --> 00:15.020
The most recent version, Claude 3.5 Sonnet New, that came out in October, is currently leading in

00:15.050 --> 00:20.870
most benchmarks, showing that it is right now probably the strongest LLM on the planet.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.080
Let's start off with a difficult question for Claude.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.240
What does it feel like to be jealous?

00:30.590 --> 00:32.450
See how it answers this?

00:32.480 --> 00:39.200
And what you'll find is that we'll get back something that is thoughtful and interesting and remarkably

00:39.200 --> 00:40.340
insightful.

00:40.370 --> 00:44.420
Uh, from my understanding, it's hinting at the fact that it doesn't experience.

00:44.420 --> 00:50.480
Jealousy itself often manifests as fear, insecurity, and desire a tight knot in your stomach.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.540
So it gives it like a almost a biological sort of sense to it and a burning sensation in your chest.

00:56.780 --> 01:00.590
Racing thoughts, uh, a sense of inadequacy or being threatened.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.570
It's really interesting.

01:02.570 --> 01:04.040
Compelling answer.

01:04.070 --> 01:07.140
No problem at all with a difficult question like that.

01:07.170 --> 01:07.680
Okay.

01:07.710 --> 01:15.000
Let's ask how many times does the letter A appear in this sentence?

01:16.500 --> 01:18.300
See how it handles that?

01:18.330 --> 01:20.700
Let me count it.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.660
Gets it wrong.

01:22.590 --> 01:24.420
Hope for humanity still.

01:24.510 --> 01:31.860
Uh, so, uh, Claude counts five times and gives an incorrect explanation for that again.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.710
We'll find out later why these sorts of questions are harder.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.240
And so, so far it's zero.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.870
One preview is the only model that was able to handle that.

01:40.050 --> 01:40.590
All right.

01:40.590 --> 01:47.340
Let's ask it a tricky question compared with other frontier llms what kinds of questions do you best

01:47.340 --> 01:49.980
at answering and what do you find most challenging?

01:50.250 --> 01:53.340
Which others compare with you?

01:53.370 --> 01:56.130
So what you get from Claude here is interesting.

01:56.130 --> 02:03.990
It pushes back and this ties to to anthropic strong views about the need for safety and alignment in

02:03.990 --> 02:04.830
models.

02:05.010 --> 02:09.690
Um, it says I aim to be direct and transparent whilst respecting my ethics.

02:09.690 --> 02:14.480
I am not comfortable making comparative claims versus other AI models.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.110
What it will then do is tell you about its own strengths and weaknesses.

02:18.110 --> 02:20.630
It's a very interesting kind of answer.

02:21.200 --> 02:28.310
By comparison, if we go back to GPT and ask it the same question, we'll see how GPT responds and what

02:28.310 --> 02:34.130
you'll find there is it doesn't have the same kind of qualms about about responding.

02:34.130 --> 02:41.090
You'll get something very clear about where it's strongest, the challenges and then complementary.

02:41.600 --> 02:49.580
So ChatGPT with web browsing and code interpreter, which I think is its name for the canvas piece,

02:49.580 --> 02:50.570
Claude.

02:50.600 --> 02:57.080
It gives interestingly as a comparison point and then it says Barred by Google and it should really

02:57.110 --> 02:58.460
say Gemini.

02:58.820 --> 03:04.850
But it's interesting that it that it does give the main competitors and it talks about some of the differences.

03:04.850 --> 03:05.510
And look at this.

03:05.510 --> 03:13.010
Fascinatingly, it does mention that Claude has more thoughtful responses on broader socio ethical considerations,

03:13.010 --> 03:15.870
which could complement my technical focus.

03:15.870 --> 03:23.520
Fascinating that not only does GPT four have that kind of ability to compare, but it gives really well

03:23.550 --> 03:25.260
considered answers to.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.600
So I thought that was particularly interesting.

03:28.140 --> 03:28.650
All right.

03:28.650 --> 03:33.330
Anyway, that gives us our quick tour of some of the features of, uh, Claude.

03:33.330 --> 03:39.690
It's also worth saying that Claude is really effective at coding and working with you on code.

03:39.750 --> 03:48.150
Let's ask it for, uh, to give an example, let's say please, uh, give me some example code that

03:48.150 --> 04:00.150
uses, uh, that, uh, some example Python that, uh, uses the open AI API.

04:00.450 --> 04:04.620
Let's see how it handles this.

04:04.620 --> 04:13.110
So what you'll see here is that it creates code in what it's called an artifact as a separate piece

04:13.110 --> 04:14.970
of code over on the right.

04:15.150 --> 04:20.220
Uh, and it then has produced quite a lot of code here.

04:20.220 --> 04:26.150
I have to say, but you'll see that it's got client, which is what we called open AI and code chat

04:26.360 --> 04:32.300
completions dot create and that the result is response dot choices, zero dot message content.

04:32.330 --> 04:35.630
Hopefully that's that's a little bit familiar to you since we did that last time.

04:35.630 --> 04:37.160
It's put it into a class.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.690
It's got some examples.

04:38.690 --> 04:45.050
And so it's written this really nicely in this thing that's called an artifact, which is it's not not

04:45.050 --> 04:47.210
quite the same as the way that canvas works with GPT four.

04:47.210 --> 04:53.120
It's a bit different, but but it allows you to see this this file, this artifact, you can then publish

04:53.120 --> 04:56.060
it to share it with other people or download it and so on.

04:56.060 --> 05:02.000
So using Claude with artifacts somewhat similar to to to canvases.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.220
And it gives you this very powerful way to do it.

05:04.220 --> 05:09.620
And as you interact it will produce more different artifacts rather than changing this one.

05:09.650 --> 05:14.030
And it's sometimes useful to have that experience too, because you can tie back and see all the different

05:14.030 --> 05:17.150
versions of the file as you worked together.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.760
So that gives you a little tour of Claude.

05:19.760 --> 05:26.390
What it's good at its sense of alignment and safety, and also the way that you can create artifacts.
