WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:03.080
But wait, there's more.

00:03.110 --> 00:07.670
We need to add some more to the user interface just to make it look more cool.

00:07.760 --> 00:13.370
And so I put a little bit more work into this, and it's not particularly worth going through the code

00:13.370 --> 00:17.660
in that much detail other than to really show you what, what I came up with.

00:17.660 --> 00:24.650
But it occurred to me that whilst it is satisfactory to see the log messages appearing so you can watch

00:24.650 --> 00:28.550
to see what's going on, it will be much nicer if we could surface them to the user interface.

00:28.580 --> 00:34.070
And that's a bit harder because typically the user interface with Gradio, it's a matter of making a

00:34.070 --> 00:38.330
request and getting back a response, but it's perfectly doable.

00:38.450 --> 00:45.350
And so whilst it's not necessarily worth us going through exactly how I approached it, but the I've

00:45.350 --> 00:50.750
now turned to a new, uh, um, file, a new module called prices.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.080
Right.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.590
Final dot pi and in the Price is Right final.

00:54.590 --> 01:02.420
I've added in some stuff at the top to handle being able to subscribe to long log messages.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.540
Um, and then I've thrown in just a little bit of extra stuff as well.

01:06.780 --> 01:13.590
So with that in mind, let's just create a new terminal window and have a look at this user interface

01:13.590 --> 01:14.340
now.

01:14.700 --> 01:19.650
So we can say um, Python price.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.050
Oh sorry I need to activate my conda environment.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.760
Obviously conda activate LMS.

01:26.850 --> 01:36.360
And now now we can say python price is right final.py.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.820
And we can see what comes up.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.360
Uh so again it thinks for a little while.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.680
Up it comes.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.830
And you're going to notice 1 or 2 changes here.

01:46.890 --> 01:56.070
Uh, so first of all, uh, as I promised, we've got this very attractive looking, uh, log here that

01:56.070 --> 02:03.270
shows you what's going on and allows you to look across the different, uh, agents as they run, see

02:03.270 --> 02:04.920
who is doing what.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.730
Uh, as before, we have our table up here, and that's going to allow us.

02:08.730 --> 02:12.830
I just clicked on that and I saw out of the corner of my eye that of course I got a push notification

02:12.830 --> 02:13.940
right away.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.070
Uh, and what do we have here?

02:16.100 --> 02:22.580
Well, what we have here is a 3D representation of our chroma database that's being used to look up

02:22.580 --> 02:27.170
the products to send to the frontier model when it appears over here.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.210
Uh, now, I know what you're thinking.

02:29.270 --> 02:36.500
You're thinking, okay, but what's the business purpose of having this particular rag knowledge store

02:36.500 --> 02:38.930
being surfaced on this user interface?

02:39.020 --> 02:43.070
Uh, and it's an important question and an important answer.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.410
Um, is that there's no purpose whatsoever.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.690
No purpose to having this diagram.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.920
It just looks great.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.850
And I want it to.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.050
And it's my course.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.730
And so I'll do it if I want to.

02:53.870 --> 02:59.450
Uh, so yeah, I mean, in all seriousness there, uh, it was nice to be able to surface some data

02:59.450 --> 03:04.730
and be able to illustrate how easy it is to get a plot to show on a Gradio user interface.

03:04.850 --> 03:10.850
Um, but, uh, this this is running, uh, just, uh, in to show off.

03:10.850 --> 03:17.660
What would perhaps be useful over time is to show in this the memory and actually be able to show in

03:17.660 --> 03:21.710
vector format the different points on the memory, and you can hover over it and see it.

03:21.890 --> 03:27.560
So maybe I'll make that adjustment myself, but or you could do it for me and push the code that would

03:27.560 --> 03:32.450
make this a little bit more useful and less of a gratuitous change.

03:32.510 --> 03:36.800
Now, the other thing that you might have noticed while I've been speaking is that the memory suddenly

03:36.800 --> 03:41.630
went blank, and you may be wondering why on earth did the memory go blank?

03:41.660 --> 03:47.240
And the reason the memory went blank is, of course, because the run has kicked off over here.

03:47.330 --> 03:53.570
And actually, again, there are ways around this, but right now, when the run is in progress, that

03:53.570 --> 03:59.360
table goes blank and then it will repopulate when the run completes, which is a bit janky and can be

03:59.360 --> 03:59.750
fixed.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.420
And that could be an exercise for you to improve the UI.

04:02.630 --> 04:07.280
Um, but you can see right now it's got to the point where it's calling modal.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.890
And so modal will be warming up.

04:10.340 --> 04:16.550
So with that, because this will take a minute, I will pause and I will come back when it has completed.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.660
See you then.
