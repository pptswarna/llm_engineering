WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:01.100
Well.

00:01.130 --> 00:02.000
Fantastic.

00:02.030 --> 00:06.560
It's coming up to the end of the week, and that means it's coming up to a challenge for you again,

00:06.560 --> 00:10.580
even though I've just given you a challenge to build a Gradio user interface for for what we just saw.

00:10.580 --> 00:11.750
But that's an easy challenge.

00:11.750 --> 00:12.680
You can do that.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.640
No problem.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.990
This you need a harder challenge.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.360
At the end of the week, it's time for a harder challenge.

00:17.360 --> 00:25.130
So the end of week challenge is to build an important business application that we will, in fact,

00:25.130 --> 00:26.690
use later in the course.

00:26.690 --> 00:32.120
Although yeah, you you won't need to to you won't need to have built it for that because because I'll

00:32.120 --> 00:32.750
have done it.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.690
But it's really helpful if you've done it.

00:35.690 --> 00:39.680
And this is something that you'll be able to use no matter in any business.

00:39.710 --> 00:45.260
This, this, this tool will apply to every business vertical and can be useful to you, I guarantee

00:45.290 --> 00:45.830
it.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.140
And this is what it is.

00:48.140 --> 00:58.940
Create your own tool that generates synthetic testing data a test data generator, open source model.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.970
This is something that is so valuable.

01:01.970 --> 01:06.380
Generating data sets is something that you need for many different purposes.

01:06.380 --> 01:14.600
And I want to give you a very, um, wide remit to decide how you want to go about doing this, but

01:14.600 --> 01:21.590
I'm looking for something where you can describe a kind of data set you want, and maybe it's descriptions

01:21.590 --> 01:29.420
of products, maybe it's descriptions of, uh, um, uh, job postings, whatever it is you want to

01:29.450 --> 01:36.260
be able to, to tell your product what it is, what kind of data that you're working with and let it

01:36.260 --> 01:45.080
dream up, uh, diverse outputs, diverse test set that you'll be able to use when experimenting with

01:45.080 --> 01:47.300
your business area in the future.

01:47.300 --> 01:55.610
So this synthetic data generator is going to be a valuable tool for yourself, for me and for for this,

01:55.640 --> 01:59.090
both for this course and for future business problems you tackle.

01:59.090 --> 02:03.890
So it's worth investing some time in, and it's worth giving it a gradio UI while you're doing it.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.720
And that's going to be the super easy part.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.420
So I have a shot at that.

02:08.450 --> 02:11.060
It will apply to your business area no matter what you do.

02:11.060 --> 02:13.790
It's going to be useful and you're going to really enjoy it.

02:16.160 --> 02:25.250
And then that would then complete week three, wrapping up your third week of your journey towards being

02:25.250 --> 02:27.800
a proficient LM engineer.

02:27.830 --> 02:31.790
You can already, of course, code confidently with frontier models.

02:31.790 --> 02:34.940
You must be sick of me saying that now because you're that good.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.100
You can build an AI assistant.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.980
You can have it be multimodal, you can have it use tools.

02:39.980 --> 02:46.010
You can have it be consist of multiple smaller agents that carry out specialist tasks.

02:46.040 --> 02:52.460
And of course, at this point you can create an LM solution that combines calls to frontier models.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.680
And it can call open source models.

02:54.680 --> 03:03.080
And you can use the pipeline API, using it to to carry out a large variety of common inference tasks.

03:03.080 --> 03:10.550
And you can also use the lower level hugging face APIs, the Tokenizers, and the models for inference

03:10.550 --> 03:11.780
tasks.

03:12.470 --> 03:18.980
So congratulations once again, you should be very proud next week.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.990
Next week we change topics.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.240
There's a thorny question.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.980
It's a question I get asked all the time.

03:24.980 --> 03:31.010
It's something which is, uh, where there's actually a lot of great resources to help.

03:31.010 --> 03:37.440
It's about how do you pick the right model for the for a given task that you have to work on.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.870
There are so many models, there are so many options.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.220
There's for staff.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.290
There's there's do you go closed source or open source?

03:43.290 --> 03:48.000
But then whichever path you take, there are so many possibilities.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.830
And how do you navigate through this to decide which one is right for a particular problem.

03:52.830 --> 03:53.850
And that is the key.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.470
It depends on the problem.

03:55.470 --> 03:58.650
Different models will be appropriate for different problems.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.660
I'm going to show you how to figure that out.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.550
We're going to compare LMS.

04:02.550 --> 04:03.720
We're going to use leaderboards.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.950
We're going to use arenas.

04:04.950 --> 04:08.070
And we're going to do some some work with arenas ourselves.

04:08.070 --> 04:09.360
And that's going to be fun.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.930
And then as our practical work, we're going to to go a different direction than we've gone in the past,

04:16.020 --> 04:21.780
except we did it very briefly once, but we're going to be looking at code generation when we're using

04:21.780 --> 04:29.490
frontier models and open source models to be generating code and tackling some code generation problems.

04:29.490 --> 04:33.060
So that will be a new, interesting perspective for you.

04:33.060 --> 04:38.910
So I'm really excited about next week, and I'm so, so impressed by how much progress you've made already

04:38.910 --> 04:42.990
and how many skills that you've already acquired.

04:43.110 --> 04:49.140
And I will see you for week four for picking the right LLM.
