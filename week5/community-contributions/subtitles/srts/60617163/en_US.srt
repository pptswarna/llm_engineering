00:00.080 --> 00:02.570
And already that wraps up day two.

00:02.570 --> 00:04.550
Now that you have built that solution.

00:04.550 --> 00:05.990
And congratulations on that.

00:05.990 --> 00:06.830
And I would love to see it.

00:06.830 --> 00:11.990
By the way, if you want to share it, uh, you've got some experience with summarization both with

00:11.990 --> 00:14.120
OpenAI and with llama.

00:14.150 --> 00:19.790
Next time we're going to have some fun with Frontier models, we're going to look at six of them.

00:19.790 --> 00:25.160
You're going to get sleeves rolled up, hands on experience with them so that we get a good sense,

00:25.190 --> 00:28.100
a good intuition to the differences between them.

00:28.190 --> 00:32.780
We're going to use some of the latest and greatest versions, and we're also going to see some areas

00:32.780 --> 00:33.740
where they struggle.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.210
So looking forward to that.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.380
I will see you then.
