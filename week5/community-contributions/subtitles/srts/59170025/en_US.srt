WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:05.000
And a massive welcome back one more time to LM engineering.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.220
We are in week three, day two and we are getting into open source models.

00:10.370 --> 00:14.960
So as a reminder you can already do frontier models back to front.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.940
You can build multimodal AI assistants.

00:16.940 --> 00:22.940
And now you're comfortable looking at the hugging face hub, looking at models and data sets and spaces.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.690
And you can run code using Google Colab.

00:27.020 --> 00:33.080
So today we're going to look at Hugging Face Transformers library and discuss the fact that there are

00:33.080 --> 00:39.950
two different types of API, two different levels that you can work with transformers at one level,

00:39.980 --> 00:46.250
the higher level API is called pipelines, and that's what we'll be working with mostly today, including

00:46.250 --> 00:50.810
generating text, images and sound using pipelines.

00:51.080 --> 00:56.570
So let's just talk for a moment about these two different API levels.

00:56.570 --> 01:02.770
So there are these two modes of interacting with the hugging face code.

01:02.770 --> 01:10.060
One of them is if you want to carry out a standard, everyday typical task in what we'd call inference,

01:10.060 --> 01:14.860
or running a model at runtime given an input to get an output.

01:14.860 --> 01:21.550
And hugging face has wonderfully packaged this up into a high level interface that's super easy to use,

01:21.550 --> 01:29.080
and that provides you with a rapid way to get going, generating text, and doing a number of everyday

01:29.080 --> 01:30.130
functions.

01:30.580 --> 01:37.360
But if you want to get deeper into the code, if you want to be looking in more detail at things like

01:37.360 --> 01:44.380
how how you are tokenizing your text at which models and which parameters you're using to run a model,

01:44.380 --> 01:50.500
or if you're actually going to go as far as training and be fine tuning your own model to carry out

01:50.530 --> 01:54.010
specialist tasks with extra knowledge or nuance.

01:54.010 --> 02:00.820
At that point, you need to look at the deeper APIs, the lower level APIs, working with Tokenizers

02:00.820 --> 02:02.800
and models in Hugging Face.

02:02.830 --> 02:05.260
Today we're going to be looking at pipelines.

02:05.260 --> 02:10.420
And then after that we're going to turn to the Tokenizers and models.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.060
So what can you do with these pipelines?

02:13.060 --> 02:22.360
So essentially it allows you to take instant advantage of models on the Hugging face hub with two lines

02:22.360 --> 02:22.960
of code.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.340
It's as simple as that.

02:24.340 --> 02:28.330
And I'm going to give you lots of examples and lots of things you can take away so that you can use

02:28.330 --> 02:32.800
it yourself to carry out every day inference tasks.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.720
So one classic example, which is one of the easiest ones to start with, is what they call sentiment

02:37.720 --> 02:38.350
analysis.

02:38.380 --> 02:43.570
Given a sentence saying what is the emotion conveyed by this sentence?

02:44.380 --> 02:50.740
Uh, then classification, of course, is one of those very traditional machine learning tasks of putting

02:50.740 --> 02:52.450
things into buckets.

02:52.660 --> 03:00.160
Named entity recognition is when you can take a sentence and tag the words in that sentence as things

03:00.160 --> 03:04.630
like whether they are people or whether they are locations or things and so on.

03:04.970 --> 03:11.900
Question answering is when you have some context and you want to be able to ask questions about the

03:11.900 --> 03:13.610
context that you provide.

03:13.640 --> 03:20.210
Summarization, of course, is when you have a block of text and you want to turn it into a summary

03:20.660 --> 03:21.710
translation.

03:21.740 --> 03:26.870
Another classic AI task translating between one language and another.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.060
So what if I told you that all of these things can be done with two lines of code each?

03:32.330 --> 03:37.370
Hopefully you would be amazed and you will see it in a moment.

03:37.490 --> 03:43.460
There are some other things you can do as well that become perhaps slightly more advanced.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.740
Text generation actually isn't advanced at all.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.120
It's still just two lines of code.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.760
It's still super simple, and it's another thing that you will marvel at.

03:53.210 --> 03:57.470
But generating images is also very simple, as is audio.

03:57.470 --> 04:02.810
It becomes a little bit more than two lines, but it's still very simple and I can't wait to show you.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.760
I think that's enough preamble.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.720
Let's get straight to it.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.340
Let's go to Google Colab.
