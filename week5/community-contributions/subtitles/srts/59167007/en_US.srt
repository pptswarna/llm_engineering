WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.780
Well, how fabulous is that?

00:02.780 --> 00:09.620
I hope that you are as wowed as I am by our new airline, I assistant and everything it can do.

00:09.620 --> 00:16.610
I've taken another screenshot here of of a conversation I'd had, and you can see again that gorgeous

00:16.610 --> 00:17.690
image of London.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.740
A very different approach now.

00:18.740 --> 00:22.430
Not the montage, but something rather rather simpler.

00:22.430 --> 00:28.790
Uh, it I find it astounding that you get such variety, such diversity of images.

00:28.850 --> 00:34.280
Um, and I also find it astounding that it's so easy to put together these sophisticated frameworks

00:34.280 --> 00:36.140
involving lots of functionality.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.890
Remember, we also had our tool running there, looking up the prices.

00:39.890 --> 00:46.400
Uh, everything we had together was a very sophisticated, complex app, complete with user interface.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.470
And we did it all just in a few hours worth of work.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.030
So it's a congratulations.

00:56.030 --> 01:01.370
But as always, there's a challenge for you and if I may say, one more time, the best way to learn

01:01.370 --> 01:02.150
is by doing.

01:02.150 --> 01:07.160
It is incredibly important that you now go and do some exercises and work on this to improve it.

01:07.190 --> 01:09.930
It's also a lot of fun as an extra bonus.

01:09.930 --> 01:11.880
So here are some of the things you can do.

01:11.910 --> 01:16.590
We talked before about adding in another tool to make a booking.

01:16.620 --> 01:21.360
In theory, not obviously a real booking, but make a booking and then it should print to an output

01:21.360 --> 01:22.680
that a booking has been made.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.120
Or maybe if you if you want, you could have it write to a file or something like that to give you a

01:27.120 --> 01:28.740
sense that the booking has happened.

01:28.770 --> 01:29.940
Add that as a tool.

01:29.940 --> 01:33.270
Hopefully you've done it already, but if not, now's a good time to do it.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.400
Then add another agent.

01:35.400 --> 01:41.040
Uh, have an agent that is able to translate all of the responses to a different language.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.500
Uh, something that we'd suggested for a previous project.

01:43.500 --> 01:48.060
But do that and then show it on the right hand side and use a different frontier model.

01:48.090 --> 01:54.240
How about Claude, for example, use Claude as a way to translate to another language of your choosing,

01:54.240 --> 01:58.140
and then you'd have to do some radio work to add another panel.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.450
With that translation.

02:00.450 --> 02:03.510
There will be a little bit of futzing around with Gradio when you do that.

02:03.510 --> 02:09.660
So you may you may find that that requires a little bit of googling, but hopefully you'll get an idea

02:09.690 --> 02:10.770
or you don't need to Google.

02:10.770 --> 02:17.520
You could actually ask, uh, Claude yourself for some advice on how to extend that Gradio app to add

02:17.520 --> 02:23.970
in that extra section to reflect the translation that it makes into another language.

02:23.970 --> 02:28.650
You'll find that when you do something like that, you provide a bunch of code and ask it to extend

02:28.650 --> 02:35.520
it, to do more, to add more capabilities, that these models are excellent at that kind of, uh,

02:35.520 --> 02:37.410
that kind of iterating on code.

02:37.800 --> 02:45.870
And then finally, since we've been enjoying multi-modality, one more multimodal task for you is audio

02:45.870 --> 02:52.890
to text, uh, add an agent that can listen to audio from your audio input source and turn it into text

02:52.890 --> 02:55.560
as the input to the AI assistant.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.150
And then you've really completed the loop.

02:57.150 --> 03:01.950
You'll be able to talk to it, and it will be able to talk back and draw images.

03:01.950 --> 03:05.040
When you were looking to ask for ticket prices.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.640
And that will then complete the week two challenge.

03:08.640 --> 03:15.780
And at that point you will be very familiar with Multi-modality and with using these, uh, stitching

03:15.810 --> 03:19.860
together these different agents to carry out a bigger task.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.790
And at that point, May I tell you?

03:24.820 --> 03:29.260
You are now 25% of the way to mastering LM engineering.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.460
25% of the way.

03:30.490 --> 03:31.720
A quarter of the way through.

03:31.750 --> 03:36.520
You can describe Transformers comfortably, including all of the terminology.

03:36.520 --> 03:43.900
You can code against the APIs, and you can build multimodal assistance using UIs, using tools, using

03:43.900 --> 03:44.560
agents.

03:44.590 --> 03:47.710
This is practically second nature to you at this point.

03:48.010 --> 03:48.340
Uh.

03:48.370 --> 03:57.910
Next week, change in topic to something that is absolutely wonderful the thriving open source community

03:57.910 --> 04:05.110
and and thriving capabilities that you have access to through open source, you're going to get to know

04:05.140 --> 04:07.720
hugging face really well, really, really well.

04:07.720 --> 04:14.050
You're going to work with pipelines and also with Tokenizers and with the models themselves with transformer

04:14.050 --> 04:15.040
models.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.430
And ultimately you're going to be running inference of open source models using Google Colab on their

04:21.430 --> 04:23.020
boxes with GPUs.

04:23.020 --> 04:30.010
And so by the end of the week, you'll be highly proficient with inference of open source models.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.540
And I can't wait to get to it.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.740
And I will see you then.
