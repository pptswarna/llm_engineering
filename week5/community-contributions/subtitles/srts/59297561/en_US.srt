00:01.160 --> 00:05.570
And would you believe at this point you're 55% of the way along the journey?

00:05.780 --> 00:09.890
Uh, it's been a while since I've thrown that stat out there, but congratulations.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.120
That's really awesome.

00:11.210 --> 00:14.270
Uh, so we have made progress with rag.

00:14.270 --> 00:18.560
We're taking it slowly because it's about to get real as we get into vector databases.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.920
But at this point, uh, not only do you have the sort of foundational understanding of why we're going

00:24.920 --> 00:31.310
to be using vectors, but you can now use Lang chain to load in documents, to split them, to add in

00:31.310 --> 00:32.120
metadata.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.620
And hopefully you've played around with that and you've satisfied yourself about how it's working and

00:36.620 --> 00:39.020
you're ready for the real deal.

00:39.020 --> 00:46.070
We next time are going to take these chunks and convert them into vectors using OpenAI's OpenAI embeddings,

00:46.070 --> 00:49.280
which was one of the encoding llms that we talked about.

00:49.310 --> 00:55.640
We're then going to store the vectors in an open source vector data store called chroma, which is an

00:55.640 --> 00:59.090
extremely popular open source vector database.

00:59.090 --> 01:00.080
And it's terrific.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.790
And we're going to enjoy putting our vectors in there, because we're then going to visualize them and

01:04.790 --> 01:10.010
see them and get a sense of what does it even mean to have a vector in a database.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.930
So lots to be done.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.790
I will see you next time.
