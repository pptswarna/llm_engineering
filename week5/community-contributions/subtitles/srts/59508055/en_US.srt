00:00.980 --> 00:06.620
I'm so very happy that you've reached this epic moment in the course and that you're hanging in there.

00:06.620 --> 00:12.110
This is where things have gotten really crucial, and we're learning some of the most important things

00:12.110 --> 00:13.640
about building an LMS.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.930
And I'm I'm just very grateful that you've been staying along and hopefully enjoying it as much as I

00:20.960 --> 00:21.530
am.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.590
And yeah, the best is yet to come.

00:24.590 --> 00:28.490
So, uh, for today, it's going to be few slides.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.320
It's going to be all action.

00:30.410 --> 00:35.360
Uh, you're going to be looking at the actual run happening and weights and biases, and I'll be showing

00:35.360 --> 00:40.070
you the sorts of things to look for and how we can use weights and biases to get some intelligence about

00:40.070 --> 00:40.970
what's happening.

00:41.270 --> 00:46.610
Uh, I'm going to show you the Huggingface hub with models in it, and you get a sense of what's going

00:46.610 --> 00:47.210
on.

00:47.420 --> 00:54.050
Um, there's also one thing that's been on my mind that I mentioned last time that I, I don't want

00:54.050 --> 00:58.220
to be flippant about the importance of keeping costs low.

00:58.310 --> 01:04.190
The idea of this class is not to build up a big bill for you from, uh, from Google, who will happily

01:04.190 --> 01:07.190
take your, your money for for running their boxes.

01:07.310 --> 01:10.010
Um, I have a lot of fun running this training.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.740
It's, um, running the training process.

01:12.800 --> 01:19.820
Um, it's perfectly achievable to do that and get good results with the spending a matter of cents.

01:19.820 --> 01:23.810
And I did want to take just a quick moment to talk about that, because it's very important.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.340
And I don't want to, uh, lead you down the wrong path of thinking you have to spend lots of money

01:28.340 --> 01:32.180
to get good results and to learn particularly, which is the main objective here.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.540
Um, and so, in fact, we're going to start with that.

01:35.600 --> 01:42.530
Um, and I want to, uh, take you straight over to JupyterLab, not not to Google Colab, but JupyterLab,

01:42.530 --> 01:47.780
where I'm going to show you something to illustrate my point and to help set you up should you wish

01:47.780 --> 01:50.090
to be training at a lower cost.
