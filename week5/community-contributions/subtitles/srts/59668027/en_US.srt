00:01.040 --> 00:04.070
And so here we are at the home page for modal.

00:04.100 --> 00:10.790
At modal.com spelt model not not model which is confusing.

00:11.330 --> 00:13.430
So what is modal.

00:13.460 --> 00:18.620
So modal is a service that allows you to take code.

00:18.650 --> 00:25.610
And it really can be any code and deploy it and run it remotely so that you can run it from, say,

00:25.640 --> 00:28.640
JupyterLab or just from some Python code running on your box.

00:28.670 --> 00:36.560
And what makes modal so powerful is that it makes it incredibly easy just to wrap up a function and

00:36.560 --> 00:39.920
have that be called so that it's almost transparent to you.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.850
It almost feels like you're calling a function that's running locally on your box.

00:43.850 --> 00:46.820
And in fact, it's been called out to the cloud.

00:46.820 --> 00:48.740
And the answer is coming back.

00:48.860 --> 00:56.060
So it gives you such transparency, and it allows you to work almost seamlessly between your box and

00:56.060 --> 00:56.900
the cloud.

00:57.170 --> 01:03.170
Now, a lot of the way it works is that it also allows you to package your code into an API, and have

01:03.170 --> 01:08.120
it running in such a way that people can use like Rest APIs to to call your code.

01:08.150 --> 01:10.760
We're not going to do that because we're working in Python.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.230
And this is all Python code.

01:12.230 --> 01:18.230
And it's even easier if all you need to do is call Python functions remotely on the cloud.

01:18.440 --> 01:24.770
Um, and whilst it is, as I say, mostly used by AI teams and for for AI as it's, as it's showing

01:24.770 --> 01:27.290
right here AI and data and machine learning.

01:27.350 --> 01:32.780
Um, it can also just be used for really any anything that you can write in Python, you can run on

01:32.780 --> 01:33.560
the cloud.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.270
Um, and so it's um, it's it's very versatile indeed.

01:38.300 --> 01:44.510
One other thing I'll mention that makes it very powerful is that you only pay for the compute time that

01:44.510 --> 01:49.880
you use, unlike services like, like, uh, you know, AWS or something.

01:50.120 --> 01:55.640
Um, it's one of these, these things where it will spin up a server on demand, and if it's not used

01:55.640 --> 02:01.700
for a while, it will, it will, it will, uh, pause that server and you'll only pay for the CPU minutes

02:01.940 --> 02:03.980
that your server is running for.

02:04.040 --> 02:11.430
So, uh, also the good news is that if you sign up for a new account, you get $30 of free credit,

02:11.430 --> 02:14.880
and we won't even come close to spending that $30.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.530
In this class.

02:16.590 --> 02:19.920
So you don't need to be concerned about about charges.

02:19.920 --> 02:26.700
This will be a freebie should you get addicted and you end up using modal for all sorts of purposes,

02:26.820 --> 02:29.370
then I can't be held accountable for that.

02:29.490 --> 02:36.120
But you will get hopefully your $30 of, uh, free credits unless they take that away.

02:36.120 --> 02:41.820
But even if they do that, as you will see, it's not exactly an expensive proposition.

02:42.240 --> 02:47.580
So when you go to modal comm, you'll need to sign up the first time and create an account if assuming

02:47.580 --> 02:48.480
you don't have one already.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.910
And once you've done that, you'll end up in a dashboard.

02:50.910 --> 02:53.280
And this is my dashboard right here.

02:53.460 --> 02:59.970
Um, and you can see here my live usage, um, in the time that I've been using modal to prepare for

02:59.970 --> 03:04.260
this class that has been going on for a while and running it a number of times, I've managed to rack

03:04.290 --> 03:08.580
up a $5 bill, uh, out of my $30 of free credit.

03:08.580 --> 03:14.960
So I've barely scratched the surface, and even if I hadn't got the free credit, it would be a $5 price

03:14.960 --> 03:16.270
tag for everything I've done so far.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.400
So, as I say, it's it's cheap.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.260
Um, here I'm looking at at apps, which are the programs that I've deployed.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.920
And of course we're going to be building a pricer service later.

03:26.950 --> 03:31.960
And if I go into this, you'll see that you can see all the different deployments that I've made of

03:31.960 --> 03:32.710
this service.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.230
And this will all make more sense when we actually do it.

03:35.410 --> 03:38.950
And you can see it's been called apparently 116 times.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.250
Uh, and you can see various other things about it.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.170
Um, but really, that's it.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.580
The one of the nice things about modal is that whilst one does have tokens and keys and all the rest

03:48.580 --> 03:52.660
of it, you don't need to go in and set it up and write it down because it's going to do it all for

03:52.660 --> 03:54.370
you and it's going to be very easy.

03:54.370 --> 03:59.170
All you have to do is sign up with an account and then everything else will come.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.030
Will will follow naturally.

04:01.390 --> 04:05.170
Okay, so with that, once you've signed up with your modal account, do some clicking around.

04:05.170 --> 04:08.320
You can always read the there's there's really nice docs.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.460
There's this this guide.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.620
You don't need to read this because we'll be doing some of this.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.270
But it gives you a real sense.

04:13.270 --> 04:17.830
There's a hello World program as well, but we'll be doing that ourselves as you will see.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.140
We'll get to that in the next video.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.430
I will see you then.
