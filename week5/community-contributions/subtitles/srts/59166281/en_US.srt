00:00.800 --> 00:08.990
And with that, amazingly, you completed day one of week two already and that gets you to the 15% point

00:08.990 --> 00:14.300
towards your goal of being an LM Engineering Master.

00:14.540 --> 00:17.810
So congratulations on getting to the 15% point.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.630
Let's talk about what you're already able to do.

00:20.810 --> 00:23.750
As you know, you can describe Transformers.

00:23.750 --> 00:30.050
And that includes all of the context window tokens, API costs and the like.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.330
You can talk about the six leading frontier LMS.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.430
You can now confidently use OpenAI's API with streaming, with markdown, with JSON.

00:37.430 --> 00:45.320
And now in addition, you can use the Anthropic and Google APIs, and you've hopefully got even deeper

00:45.320 --> 00:52.160
insights into that structure of messages, that list of dicts that is going to feature from time to

00:52.190 --> 00:55.490
time, as you will see tomorrow.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.730
Tomorrow is a day that I've been looking forward to for a long time.

00:58.730 --> 01:05.570
I am going to be gushing gushing about Gradio, which I think is an absolutely fabulous platform and

01:05.570 --> 01:07.610
you are going to see why yourself.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.390
You're going to see why I love it so much, and I'm hoping that you're going to love it too.

01:11.420 --> 01:16.970
We're going to create a simple UI with Gradio, and we're going to hook it up to Frontier Models, and

01:16.970 --> 01:19.100
it's going to be really, really easy.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.360
And I will see you then.
