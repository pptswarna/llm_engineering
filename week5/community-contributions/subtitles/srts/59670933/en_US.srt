00:00.530 --> 00:06.770
I realized my enthusiasm for this project is a bit insane, but I have to tell you that I am very satisfied

00:06.770 --> 00:07.670
with the outcome.

00:07.700 --> 00:12.620
It's rare that you come up with a project like this that has so many moving parts and is technically

00:12.620 --> 00:20.240
quite complex and has a lot of substance to it, but have such a simple and tangible outcome as our

00:20.240 --> 00:22.340
push notification for a good deal.

00:22.520 --> 00:29.750
There is something beyond the king of the notification that really makes this very satisfying indeed.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.660
But one point that I wanted to make about it, perhaps a more, more seriously, is to point out that

00:35.660 --> 00:41.120
this sort of template that we've got here for solving this problem is something that you can apply to

00:41.150 --> 00:46.940
a lot of other similar kinds of business problems and startup ideas and commercial problems that you

00:46.940 --> 00:48.680
might even have been thinking about already.

00:48.710 --> 00:53.570
I mean, to give you something that comes to mind right away is that when I was looking on hugging face

00:53.570 --> 01:00.020
for the data for this this project, for the Amazon pricing data, I also came across a bunch of data

01:00.020 --> 01:07.670
that that has company reports, annual reports from companies and shows how that relates to the change

01:07.670 --> 01:14.610
in share price on the day and the few days after the report comes out, which is a very interesting

01:14.610 --> 01:15.420
data set.

01:15.420 --> 01:22.110
And it occurs to me that whilst this is more of a stretch, it is also obviously a bigger opportunity

01:22.110 --> 01:23.580
if you can find a way to crack it.

01:23.610 --> 01:30.810
If there's a way to build a proprietary model that's able to look at that and make some prediction about

01:30.810 --> 01:35.130
what will happen to the share price as a result of a company's report being published.

01:35.160 --> 01:41.910
And you could imagine then having a scanner agent that scans the new company reports being being being

01:41.910 --> 01:42.630
released.

01:42.660 --> 01:49.170
And so you can really see the very similar agent workflow that you would adapt for that kind of of of

01:49.170 --> 01:49.710
problem.

01:49.710 --> 01:54.660
Now, of course, I will tell you that any trading decisions that you make are entirely at your own

01:54.660 --> 01:56.880
risk, and I have nothing to do with them at all.

01:57.060 --> 02:03.120
And obviously no one has yet cracked that problem of being able to build an automated AI system that

02:03.120 --> 02:09.000
can do things like read company reports and make, uh, trading decisions robust trading decisions as

02:09.000 --> 02:09.510
a result.

02:09.510 --> 02:15.810
But it seems like a serious, a very, um, important challenge to take on.

02:15.810 --> 02:21.060
And I wanted to point that out because it shows you how similar that is in terms of the the bits and

02:21.060 --> 02:24.360
pieces of the puzzle that you would look at if you wanted to do that.

02:24.360 --> 02:33.160
So that could certainly be a big challenge, if nothing else, just for the interest of seeing what

02:33.160 --> 02:38.200
happens and seeing whether you can find signal in that kind of data and using it as an opportunity to

02:38.230 --> 02:40.600
build a similar agent workflow.

02:41.410 --> 02:42.040
Okay.

02:42.070 --> 02:49.930
Anyway, with that, let's move to the last slide of this week, which is of this sorry, not of this

02:49.930 --> 02:54.430
week, of this day, which is to tell you that there is now one day left.

02:54.430 --> 02:59.890
There is one final day, week eight, day five, which will be the conclusion of this course.

02:59.890 --> 03:01.930
And you don't want to miss it.

03:02.050 --> 03:07.210
Uh, before I tell you what you'll do, then just to remind you, at this point you can generate code

03:07.210 --> 03:13.510
and text with frontier models, with open source models, using hugging face, using APIs with tools,

03:13.510 --> 03:18.760
structured outputs, rag with assistance from from Gradio.

03:18.790 --> 03:25.180
You can follow that strategy we went through to solve problems including curating your data, which

03:25.180 --> 03:30.280
is hard and grueling, but perhaps the single most important step.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.330
Um, making your baseline model and fine tuning a frontier model.

03:34.330 --> 03:38.380
And then you can Select and train an open source model.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.370
And we did it.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.010
We beat the frontier when we did that.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.770
You can deploy models to production.

03:44.770 --> 03:48.730
Now you can use modal to to put something up there on the cloud.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.980
You can also productionize your code in other ways and prepare it into something that can be run in

03:53.980 --> 03:55.750
production environments.

03:56.140 --> 04:03.400
And now you can build agentic workflows with planning memory, databases and multiple agents working

04:03.430 --> 04:07.030
together to take a complex task and break it down.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.470
And so that brings us to preparing for tomorrow.

04:11.470 --> 04:16.780
Tomorrow, of course, we're going to be building a user interface, which is going to be glorious because

04:16.780 --> 04:17.920
it's in Gradio.

04:18.040 --> 04:23.980
Uh, we'll also be looking at the fact that today when we ran that workflow, you'll notice that it

04:23.980 --> 04:25.270
ran and then it completed.

04:25.270 --> 04:30.730
So it's not really autonomous and it doesn't keep running and have it still relies on the human to press

04:30.730 --> 04:31.330
it each time.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.950
So we need to fix that of course.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.320
So we will do both of those things tomorrow.

04:35.320 --> 04:43.270
And once they are done, that will leave you in a position where you will have mastered AI and LM engineering.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.100
And I can't wait for that point.

04:45.100 --> 04:49.300
I hope that you are both excited and proud and I will see you there.
