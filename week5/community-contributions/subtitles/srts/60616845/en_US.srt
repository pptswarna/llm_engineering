00:00.050 --> 00:01.400
We're on the home stretch.

00:01.400 --> 00:04.880
This is the final step in the environment setup, and it's an easy one.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.980
It's one that's easy to make mistakes as well.

00:06.980 --> 00:10.430
But I'm going to guide you through it and there'll be no problems whatsoever.

00:10.430 --> 00:15.170
I'm going to show it to you both on a mac and a PC all in one video, so you guys can see how it works

00:15.170 --> 00:15.890
for both.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.150
And it's pretty simple.

00:17.150 --> 00:23.960
It's called creating a dot env file, which is a common way to store secrets in a way that you can access

00:23.960 --> 00:29.990
in your project that don't get checked into source code control doesn't go into into git, which means

00:29.990 --> 00:31.850
that your secrets are safe.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.230
We're going to start with a mac.

00:33.230 --> 00:41.300
Here I am, I am going to go into my projects folder that we set up into LM engineering.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.180
So we are now in the project root directory, as I say.

00:44.390 --> 00:48.890
Um, and what I'm going to do is create a file called dot env.

00:48.890 --> 00:55.040
And the way that you create a file from, from the, the way you bring up an editor in here is you can

00:55.040 --> 00:57.830
use nano, which is a very popular tool.

00:57.830 --> 01:03.050
And the name of our file, the thing we're going to create is going to be called dot EMV, literally

01:03.050 --> 01:03.560
a period.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.940
And then the letters EMV.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.470
Now here's the thing.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.510
This is a fussy step.

01:08.510 --> 01:11.750
The name of the file must be exactly dot EMV.

01:11.840 --> 01:19.010
It can't be like my keys dot EMV or EMV and it can't be dot EMV, dot text or anything like that.

01:19.010 --> 01:23.600
It's got to be exactly dot EMV, otherwise it doesn't find it.

01:23.630 --> 01:25.370
So that's that's the rule.

01:25.490 --> 01:30.470
And now that I've done that, up comes a new empty file called dot EMV.

01:31.010 --> 01:32.930
And what I'm going to put in here is very simple.

01:32.930 --> 01:35.210
And of course this is all laid out in the in the readme.

01:35.210 --> 01:41.870
But I'm going to put in this file just open AI underscore API underscore key equals.

01:41.870 --> 01:49.580
And now I put in here the key itself that that I have hopefully stored very safely from the last video.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.720
And it begins scmproj dash blah blah blah.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.360
Put that in the file and don't have any.

01:56.390 --> 01:59.840
Don't have a space before the equals sign or after the equals sign.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.840
And there's one other like really unpleasant.

02:02.870 --> 02:03.530
Gotcha.

02:03.530 --> 02:09.590
If you've if you use the notebook on the notes application on Mac, I use that a lot.

02:09.620 --> 02:16.760
Sometimes if you paste something in there and then press enter and copy it out, it replaces hyphens

02:16.760 --> 02:19.430
with long dashes if you're not careful.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.650
So just make sure that that whatever.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.960
If you haven't copied it straight from that website, that nothing has got mangled in your key.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.490
That was a really hard problem.

02:28.490 --> 02:33.620
That it took me a while to track down that one student had, but maybe it's just a rare situation that

02:33.620 --> 02:34.190
that happens.

02:34.190 --> 02:37.370
But anyways, if you've been careful, we've got the key just like this.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.560
You've got the full key laid out there, and then you press, as it says on the on the bottom of the

02:42.560 --> 02:48.590
screen on a mac, command O or control O to save, and X gets out of it.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.480
Now there's one thing to look out for.

02:50.480 --> 02:56.570
If I do an LHS, you'll see that there isn't a EMV file here, and you'll also not see one when we look

02:56.570 --> 02:57.530
in JupyterLab.

02:57.530 --> 03:00.570
And the reason is because any file that begins with a dot.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.820
A mac considers to be a hidden file, a secret file, and if you want to see that, you'd have to do

03:05.850 --> 03:10.170
ls minus A, and then you see all of the hidden files, and you'll now see included.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.300
On the bottom left there is EMV.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.090
And if I want to see what contents that has.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.140
You'll see that it has the OpenAI API key.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.800
And of course in your case hopefully you have a full key in there.

03:22.980 --> 03:24.390
So that's it.

03:24.390 --> 03:25.560
That's the Mac version.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.760
Let's look on a PC.

03:27.270 --> 03:32.370
Let me flip over to my emulator of PCs over here.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.390
Here we have it.

03:33.570 --> 03:38.190
So on a PC the thing to use is the program called notepad.

03:38.190 --> 03:43.800
And you can press the windows and R to run and then type notepad and press okay.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.390
And up comes notepad.

03:46.110 --> 03:53.550
Uh, in this notepad we say open AI underscore API underscore key equals.

03:53.550 --> 03:59.190
And then you paste in your key which should start scmproj dash blah blah blah blah blah.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.840
That should go in here.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.440
And then you go file and you go save as.

04:04.470 --> 04:10.650
Now you then will have to navigate around to find your way to the LM engineering folder, which I've

04:10.650 --> 04:12.570
already got set up right here.

04:12.570 --> 04:13.140
And now.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.000
There's like a little gotcha here, a little trick.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.280
You have to know where it says save as type.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.890
You have to change that to be all files.

04:19.890 --> 04:22.920
And now in here you can type dot EMV.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.120
And I will save this right now.

04:27.180 --> 04:28.740
And that should be done.

04:29.010 --> 04:30.060
Exit.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.680
And now back over here.

04:31.680 --> 04:38.340
If I do an LZ we do see that there is a dot EMV and it doesn't have any nasty name to it.

04:38.340 --> 04:43.920
So that has been created successfully and that is the final step.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.610
We are now finally ready to actually go and do a lab.

04:47.610 --> 04:48.780
Congratulations!

04:48.810 --> 04:49.560
Congratulations!

04:49.560 --> 04:53.880
I guess I should hold the congratulations until you see it working in the lab, but tentative.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.690
Congratulations on getting it this far and I can't wait to see you for the next video.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.250
When we're actually going to do something.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.000
See you there.
