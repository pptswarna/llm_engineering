00:00.110 --> 00:05.360
So what we're now going to do is we're going to look at some models in practice and start to compare

00:05.360 --> 00:06.770
them and ask some questions.

00:06.770 --> 00:11.180
Some of the questions we're going to ask, we're going to ask how do I decide if a business problem

00:11.180 --> 00:13.580
is suitable for an LM solution?

00:13.580 --> 00:17.480
Because it's again useful for us to hear the answer and to learn from it.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.490
But also it would be good to see.

00:19.610 --> 00:25.220
I imagine you'll see that that's a question that none of the models will have any problems with, and

00:25.250 --> 00:26.690
it'll be great to see that.

00:26.990 --> 00:31.100
I will also ask a question which I think is interesting because it's sort of introspective.

00:31.100 --> 00:38.330
It sees whether the models have a sense of of what they are by saying compared to other LMS, what kinds

00:38.330 --> 00:44.090
of questions are you best at answering and where do you where do you have challenges and which other

00:44.120 --> 00:47.000
LMS have capabilities that complement yours?

00:47.000 --> 00:54.470
So it's an interesting one to see if they even recognize that they are LMS and can sort of assess themselves

00:54.470 --> 00:55.610
against others.

00:55.610 --> 01:01.280
And then a question which surely will be something which which they will struggle with, because it's

01:01.280 --> 01:02.780
something that I would struggle with.

01:02.810 --> 01:05.810
What does it feel like to be jealous?

01:06.140 --> 01:14.510
A yeah, a philosophical and a very human centric question, and then a rather interesting one.

01:14.510 --> 01:18.440
How many times does the letter A appear in this sentence?

01:18.740 --> 01:23.300
And if you do a quick count there, I think you'll find that it appears four times, and we'll see whether

01:23.300 --> 01:25.640
the models can figure out that it appears four times.

01:25.670 --> 01:28.880
And then there are a couple of other interesting things I have up my sleeve to ask.

01:28.880 --> 01:35.900
So we'll be going through and the screenshots you see here ChatGPT, you'll see Claude, Gemini and

01:35.960 --> 01:39.680
Commander Plus from cohere, and we'll try the other ones too.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.960
And again, please do bear in mind, try looking and understanding the differences and seeing how you'll

01:44.960 --> 01:48.260
be able to apply this to your own model selection.

01:48.260 --> 01:49.250
See you in a second.
