00:00.830 --> 00:06.770
The mantra of this course is that the best way to learn is by doing, and we will be doing stuff together

00:06.770 --> 00:07.340
throughout.

00:07.370 --> 00:12.350
There will be eight commercial projects which will be applying what you're learning to real business

00:12.350 --> 00:15.380
problems, and they'll be exercises for you to do the same thing.

00:15.380 --> 00:21.050
And I'm hoping that you'll be able to set up GitHub and be able to make your own versions and push them

00:21.050 --> 00:26.030
and send me a PR, a pull request, and I'll be able to merge in your code so that other people can

00:26.030 --> 00:27.320
see your solutions too.

00:27.350 --> 00:32.570
But you'll be able to add this to your GitHub and be able to show yourself that you are building projects

00:32.570 --> 00:34.790
to solve real world commercial problems.

00:34.790 --> 00:38.570
One of our projects I mentioned is going to be a chatbot assistant.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.100
We're going to build one for an airline.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.400
It's going to be able to do things like use tools to look up the price of tickets.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.230
It's going to make audio and it's going to show pictures like this beautiful pop art version of London

00:48.230 --> 00:52.490
showing here on the right as you interact with the chatbot assistant.

00:52.910 --> 00:58.910
We're also going to be building rag pipelines, putting vectors of information in a vector data store

00:58.940 --> 01:03.260
that you'll have running, and we'll be able to look at things like visualizations of the vectors,

01:03.260 --> 01:09.920
mess around with them in 3D space, look into them to understand how different kinds of information

01:09.920 --> 01:15.980
get placed in different locations in vector space, and why that is fundamental to Rag retrieval, augmented

01:15.980 --> 01:16.910
generation.

01:16.910 --> 01:21.800
And then, as I say, the the moment, the big moment in the project will be in week eight, when we

01:21.800 --> 01:27.620
will build an Agentic AI solution that will bring together everything that you've learned about through

01:27.620 --> 01:31.340
the eight weeks for something which will solve a business problem.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.260
And I'll be able to give you some examples of how you can then apply that to solving other business

01:36.260 --> 01:39.260
problems that you might face in the future, or that you might have today.

01:39.320 --> 01:44.660
And you'll be able to watch as agents collaborate, you'll see the memory of the agents and see what's

01:44.660 --> 01:47.180
going on in our agent world.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.890
A lot to look forward to.
