00:01.220 --> 00:03.740
Well, I have to tell you that I'm a little bit sad.

00:03.740 --> 00:07.760
This is the beginning of the beginning of the end.

00:07.970 --> 00:10.940
It's the beginning of our last time together.

00:10.970 --> 00:11.780
The final.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.400
The end of the finale.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.330
The conclusion of our eight week voyage.

00:17.330 --> 00:21.860
To take you from the very beginning to LLM mastery.

00:21.860 --> 00:25.970
And what a fitting conclusion it should hopefully be.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.940
I realize I maybe oversold some of the excitement that was in store, but I do hope that you shared

00:31.940 --> 00:37.820
some of it with me, that you also enjoyed this project and that you're ready for the last stages.

00:37.820 --> 00:43.610
So what you can do now is so much to it that I couldn't possibly, possibly do it.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.010
The injustice of squeezing it into three bullets.

00:46.010 --> 00:48.590
So it now dominates most of this page.

00:48.590 --> 00:56.660
And obviously what's in store for us today is to get to the top of the mountain and complete the mastering

00:56.690 --> 01:05.990
of AI and engineering and LLM engineering, the missing piece for us, if we look at our Agentic AI

01:06.020 --> 01:13.040
solution, we covered each of these different pieces, and perhaps the one that we hadn't yet completely

01:13.040 --> 01:15.590
ticked the box of was having autonomy.

01:15.620 --> 01:16.520
We have got memory.

01:16.550 --> 01:21.560
We've in a sense, although there's not much point in having memory if it doesn't, if it only runs

01:21.560 --> 01:22.310
once.

01:22.490 --> 01:30.060
So yeah, we really need to pull all of this together and have it into a process that is running, and

01:30.060 --> 01:35.820
so that you'll be able to kick something off and then just go away and get on with your daily life and

01:35.820 --> 01:36.900
get texted.

01:36.900 --> 01:44.160
Push notified from time to time as deals come up on the internet that seem worthy of your attention.

01:44.460 --> 01:50.760
Uh, and so this one more time was the agentic workflows that we had put together.

01:50.760 --> 01:58.530
And of course, we built everything in red in one session when we we built out our, our prices, including

01:58.530 --> 02:05.310
the specialist pricing that calls out to modal and the frontier processor that uses our chroma lookup.

02:05.550 --> 02:10.260
Um, and then we built an ensemble that takes the weighted average of them all.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.590
Uh, and we then assembled it together with our scanner and our messaging and planning so that we'd

02:16.590 --> 02:18.060
have everything together.

02:18.060 --> 02:24.900
And then last time we used something that was fancily called an agent framework, but was nothing more

02:24.900 --> 02:27.750
than a Python script to glue everything together.

02:27.750 --> 02:32.880
And of course you can, as I say, get agent frameworks through through various off the shelf frameworks.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.670
But most of what they're doing is exactly what we did ourselves, uh, through simple Python.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.420
All right.

02:39.420 --> 02:45.660
So what remains, what remains is for us to go back with one last time to JupyterLab, where we will

02:45.660 --> 02:49.080
start playing with my old friend Gradio.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.090
Uh, we will be right there.
