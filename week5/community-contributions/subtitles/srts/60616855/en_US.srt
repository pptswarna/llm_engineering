WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:01.760
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:01.790 --> 00:04.190
We've been building environments for so long.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.330
Are we not done yet?

00:05.360 --> 00:06.740
We're almost done.

00:06.770 --> 00:07.940
We're almost done.

00:07.940 --> 00:13.100
There's two more steps to go, and then we are through with environment setup and onto projects.

00:13.100 --> 00:21.440
So the next thing we have to do is set up our keys to use open AI so that we can connect from our JupyterLab

00:21.440 --> 00:26.420
environment to run with some of the most powerful models on the planet.

00:26.690 --> 00:33.320
Uh, if you go to the Readme, uh, in our GitHub repository and you scroll down a little bit, we'll

00:33.320 --> 00:39.740
get to the point where there are the links to the major providers, and we're just going to be using

00:39.740 --> 00:41.480
open AI for this week.

00:41.480 --> 00:46.820
And if you click on that link, it will take us to the open AI page.

00:46.820 --> 00:52.820
If you've never been before, you will have to sign up or sign in using Google credentials or creating

00:52.820 --> 00:53.930
an account.

00:54.260 --> 00:59.720
Now, before we go further, I have to explain something that's pretty confusing, which does sometimes,

00:59.720 --> 01:11.550
uh, throw people all of the major closed source providers like OpenAI and anthropic for Cloud and Google

01:11.550 --> 01:19.110
for Gemini have two different types of plan that are completely separate and don't have any relationship

01:19.110 --> 01:19.980
with each other.

01:20.010 --> 01:28.380
One of them relates to their web tools, the front end tools, which you can use to chat with like famously

01:28.410 --> 01:30.720
ChatGPT that we all know well.

01:30.750 --> 01:37.980
ChatGPT has a pro plan that you can pay for if you want to, to be able to use some of the latest models

01:37.980 --> 01:42.990
that we'll look at later, like, oh one preview and GPT four with canvas and others.

01:43.050 --> 01:46.020
Uh, that needs a pro plan in some cases.

01:46.050 --> 01:52.440
Uh, and the Pro plan costs about $20 a month in the US and similar pricing in other regions.

01:52.770 --> 01:57.420
Um, a fixed monthly price, and then you have almost unlimited access to those models.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.220
The same is true for anthropic.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.660
Uh, same same kind of thing.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.180
And, uh, Google Gemini also.

02:03.830 --> 02:08.720
But this is entirely separate to the API world.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.810
The API world is where you can use.

02:11.810 --> 02:18.230
You can call out to the model directly using code, and it's running on the cloud, and it will respond

02:18.260 --> 02:20.390
with answers to your questions.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.330
It's a different type of pricing plan.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.880
It is there's no monthly subscription.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.670
There's no no payment whatsoever monthly.

02:28.670 --> 02:32.240
But you do have to pay per API request.

02:32.240 --> 02:39.200
It's a pay per request situation, and the payment per request will talk more detail about API costs

02:39.200 --> 02:39.680
later.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.390
But it's really tiny for any project that we work on in this course.

02:44.390 --> 02:50.600
For most of the projects, except where I will mention otherwise, it is a fraction of a cent it is

02:50.600 --> 02:59.300
tiny, so there is really no harm in trying out some of these APIs and it gets you such power, gives

02:59.300 --> 03:03.710
you access to such incredible models, even though some of the models will use their open source are

03:03.710 --> 03:04.550
very powerful.

03:04.550 --> 03:11.010
These frontier closed source models are super powerful, as you will see, and so it makes sense that

03:11.010 --> 03:16.050
you have to pay a small amount for the compute that goes behind the processing to to generate these

03:16.050 --> 03:16.980
responses.

03:17.190 --> 03:20.400
But having said that, there is a hitch.

03:20.430 --> 03:26.310
There is something about this pricing, uh, which is uh, in some cases it's uh, it's new and it may

03:26.340 --> 03:33.450
be different in different regions, but certainly for me and for, for OpenAI, uh, they have a minimum

03:33.450 --> 03:36.180
that you have to put down to use the API.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.480
And in my case right now it is a $5 minimum.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.880
So you have to put in at least $5.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.020
And then as you use the API, you'll start to charge down against that $5.

03:46.020 --> 03:51.630
We're not going to use we're going to use a fraction of that and this entire course, uh, but there'll

03:51.660 --> 03:54.660
be plenty of other ways that you can use that $5.

03:54.660 --> 03:55.500
I assure you.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.390
There are so many projects will build.

03:57.390 --> 04:03.090
There'll be so many exercises for you for real, useful things, ways that you'll be able to spend that

04:03.120 --> 04:05.010
and have a good outcome from it.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.450
So my sales pitch to you would be that it is well worth it.

04:08.450 --> 04:12.950
I would do it, but it is, of course a personal choice.

04:13.220 --> 04:19.400
If you don't feel comfortable putting down the $5 or you'd rather not, that's fine.

04:19.520 --> 04:25.160
You can watch me as I go through the exercises, and what I'll do is I'll show you a way that you can

04:25.160 --> 04:26.600
use open source models.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.330
Instead, we'll be able to use a llama.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.070
The thing that we did at the very, very start, and you'll be able to use that as an alternative to

04:34.100 --> 04:35.570
using a frontier model.

04:35.570 --> 04:38.240
Now, the results, of course, are not going to be the same.

04:38.360 --> 04:44.420
The it's a, uh, the llama models will be using as like a 2 billion parameter model, uh, compared

04:44.420 --> 04:52.580
to GPT four, that is rumored to be about 10 trillion parameters, uh, perhaps like 10,000 times as

04:52.580 --> 04:52.940
many.

04:52.940 --> 04:58.190
So it is a different quality of model, but you would have to put down that $5 up front.

04:58.190 --> 05:00.200
So that's the decision for you.

05:00.290 --> 05:03.590
And again I my my take is that it is worth it.

05:04.070 --> 05:09.470
So in order to do this though, what you need to do is once you've come into the OpenAI platform, you've

05:09.470 --> 05:11.040
logged in, you've got to this point.

05:11.190 --> 05:12.750
There's just two things you have to do.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.990
You first have to go to the settings button up here.

05:15.990 --> 05:20.520
And on settings over here you go to billing and on billing.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.910
This is where you need to have some credit balance to be able to use the GPT four zero.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.420
And the minimum that it will take is $5.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.600
You have to press add to credit balance and then punch in a credit card.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.410
And it will take $5 and keep auto recharge off.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.030
You don't want them snapping from your card without your permission.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.340
As I say this, this has been it.

05:44.550 --> 05:51.450
I use it all the time, and I barely manage to get beyond a few cents a day because we use the GPT four

05:51.660 --> 05:56.910
mini, the cheap version, almost exclusively on this project, on this course.

05:57.000 --> 05:57.510
So.

05:57.510 --> 06:03.870
So this $5 is more than enough and you'll be able to put it to fine use, I assure you.

06:03.870 --> 06:09.270
So if you are comfortable doing this then go ahead, go to billing, put on your $5.

06:09.510 --> 06:17.040
And then the next thing is to go to dashboard over here and then down to API keys here.

06:17.490 --> 06:24.330
And then you have to come here and press this create new secret key button right here.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.850
Uh, you have it set to you.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.560
You can give it a name if you wish.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.850
You give permissions all and then you press the Create Secret key button.

06:32.850 --> 06:37.830
And when you do that, it's going to show you a new secret key that you will have created.

06:37.830 --> 06:41.610
And it will give you a chance to copy that secret key into your clipboard.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.610
And you need to do that because it won't let you ever see it again.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.250
This is the most you'll ever see of that secret key again.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.450
It is your secret and you have to copy it and keep it somewhere safe.

06:51.450 --> 06:53.490
We will use it in just a second.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.780
Once you've done that, we'll be ready to actually put this key to use.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.010
And we are almost there.

06:59.010 --> 07:00.540
We are almost done.

07:00.540 --> 07:04.080
So with any luck, you have now got a secret key copied.

07:04.080 --> 07:09.570
You've forked out $5 or local currency equivalent and you're ready to go.

07:09.570 --> 07:14.190
And I will see you in the next video for the very final step of setting up our environment.
