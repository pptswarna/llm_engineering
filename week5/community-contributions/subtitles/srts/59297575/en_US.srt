Well, welcome to the final part on rag.

00:04.550 --> 00:10.310
And this is the session where you go from being a rag expert to being a rag master.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.010
Uh, we are going to look today at a few things.

00:13.010 --> 00:20.780
We're going to look at the Lang chain, LCL, the Lang chain expression language, which is where we

00:20.780 --> 00:24.440
look at the declarative language for setting up these chains.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.640
Uh, and it's not something we're going to use in earnest, but we'll take a look at it.

00:28.790 --> 00:34.520
I'm going to talk a bit about how Lang Chain works behind the scenes, and we're going to fix and diagnose

00:34.520 --> 00:37.700
some common problems that come up with rag.

00:37.730 --> 00:41.600
And there's something else, something else that I just slipped in because I couldn't resist it.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.120
Something that I said we could do that was really easy.

00:44.150 --> 00:47.240
Uh, and I want to show you that we certainly can.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.950
And in fact, we're going to do that right away.

00:48.980 --> 00:54.470
So before we get on with the rest of today's activities, I'm going to take you to JupyterLab and show

00:54.470 --> 01:01.070
you something that I just knocked up to prove a little point, but to also illustrate another vector

01:01.070 --> 01:01.790
database.

01:01.790 --> 01:02.690
See you there.
