WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:06.860
So here we are on Hugging Face's main landing page at Hugging Face Core.

00:06.890 --> 00:07.790
A URL you know.

00:07.790 --> 00:11.390
Well, since we produced the company brochure for Hugging Face a couple of times.

00:11.510 --> 00:14.270
And, uh, this is this is what you'll see.

00:14.270 --> 00:16.760
If you're not logged in, you don't have an account.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.530
You'll see a screen like this.

00:18.530 --> 00:20.870
And the first thing you need to do is go to sign up.

00:20.870 --> 00:27.470
If you don't already have a hugging face account, it is free to join email address and a password and

00:27.470 --> 00:29.210
then you will be in.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.810
And once you're in, you'll get to see something like this.

00:33.590 --> 00:40.040
Uh, the main navigation of Hugging Face is up here, and you can see the first three parts of the main

00:40.040 --> 00:42.680
navigation are models, datasets and spaces.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.050
And that is what we're going to look at right now.

00:45.350 --> 00:52.820
So the first tab models, this is where in the hugging face platform or the hub as it's known, you

00:52.820 --> 00:56.690
can see all of the models that are available to you.

00:56.900 --> 01:02.090
I said before that it's more than 800,000 is in fact more than 900,000.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.140
Look at that.

01:03.530 --> 01:10.460
And this is sorted, I think, by default by trending, which is some combination of recency and popularity.

01:10.490 --> 01:16.580
You can also turn that into by how popular it is, how many times it's been downloaded and how recently

01:16.580 --> 01:18.320
it was created or updated.

01:19.310 --> 01:24.920
As you can see here, the name of each of these models is typically the name of the organization and

01:24.920 --> 01:26.450
then the name of the model.

01:26.780 --> 01:34.610
Flux is one of the latest and most exciting text to image models, and I do believe we'll be playing

01:34.610 --> 01:35.780
with that at some point.

01:36.110 --> 01:42.170
Quanta, the powerhouse model from Alibaba Cloud that I've mentioned a few times now.

01:42.170 --> 01:48.590
And you can see typically you have the number of parameters often in the description of a lamb.

01:48.590 --> 01:56.540
And then instruct at the end tells us that this has been fine tuned to be most applicable during a sort

01:56.540 --> 02:01.980
of chat and instruct kind of interaction with the input.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.820
And we can see lots of other models here.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.740
There's of course a filter up here.

02:07.740 --> 02:16.830
So we can filter on something like llama to look at the llama model, which was Meta's model, which

02:16.830 --> 02:20.400
is so very well known, so very popular.

02:20.550 --> 02:21.240
Here it is.

02:21.270 --> 02:26.550
These are all various um, times that meta or llama will have been mentioned at some point in these

02:26.550 --> 02:27.000
descriptions.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.220
But you can see what we're really looking for is is here this is Meta llama 3.18 billion version model.

02:35.220 --> 02:39.720
And that's the same one fine tuned for the instruct use case.

02:39.750 --> 02:43.500
The this kind of uh um chat use case.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.000
So let's go in here.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.540
If you go into llama 3.18 billion, you see a ton of information about it.

02:51.540 --> 02:55.170
You see that it's been downloaded a large number of times.

02:55.320 --> 03:00.450
Uh, recently we'll be downloading it ourselves, I think, on many occasions over the coming weeks.

03:00.570 --> 03:06.990
Uh, you get some information about the model architecture, uh, the languages, the family, the how

03:06.990 --> 03:12.270
it's intended to be used, and then some code examples down at the end.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.420
Uh, so this is all useful stuff to read about.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.550
Also information about how it was trained.

03:17.820 --> 03:22.590
Um, and lots of other things worth reading about.

03:23.100 --> 03:30.330
There's also this tab here, Files and Versions, which opens up something that looks a bit like a git

03:30.330 --> 03:31.380
repository.

03:31.380 --> 03:36.480
And it's funny you should think that because it actually is a git repository.

03:36.510 --> 03:42.930
A lot of what you can think of the hugging face hub as is a sort of interface on top of a series of

03:42.960 --> 03:44.190
git repos.

03:44.190 --> 03:51.330
And often when you're downloading a model or downloading data, what you're really doing is doing a

03:51.360 --> 03:56.830
sort of a pull from git get and getting these files locally.

03:56.830 --> 04:08.110
So this is the the the the folder and file structure that sits behind the meta llama 3.18 billion.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.430
And there are various ways that you can use it.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.020
There's a button here.

04:14.020 --> 04:18.880
Use this model that will give you more information if you go into it on what you need to do.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.490
That gives you actual examples of code.

04:21.490 --> 04:24.370
We'll be using this code later, so don't worry about it right now.

04:24.670 --> 04:28.780
You don't need to to read this, but know that you can always go to use this model.

04:28.780 --> 04:34.390
Select Transformers, which means you want to use it using hugging face Transformers library, and then

04:34.390 --> 04:38.230
copy code examples directly from the user interface.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.850
As simple as that.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.270
And there's other stuff here that we'll look at another day.

04:43.300 --> 04:50.290
There's some tags of course, which also allows you to filter on different, uh, aspects of models

04:50.290 --> 04:51.940
very quickly and easily.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.420
We'll be looking at lots of other models in time.

04:55.420 --> 05:01.750
We'll be looking at things like the Phi model from Microsoft and which I think I mentioned.

05:01.780 --> 05:08.680
We'll be looking, of course, at quanta, and that you've actually already seen and plenty of others.

05:08.680 --> 05:14.350
Maybe I'll mention Google's Gemma that you'll see Gemma will come up when I do this.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.750
Um, it did come up and then it went away.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.900
So let's do Google slash Gemma.

05:19.930 --> 05:21.070
There we go.

05:21.340 --> 05:30.850
Um, so this, for example, the 2 billion very small on device version of Gemma and it as before has

05:30.850 --> 05:37.990
the description, the code examples, the files and versions and the ability to use this model just

05:37.990 --> 05:40.360
by clicking there like so.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.280
That's models.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.080
Let's move on to data sets.

05:44.110 --> 05:50.920
Data sets shows you the vast resource of data that's available on the Hugging Face hub.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.470
And again, you've got the ability to search.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.600
It's sorted by default on trending.

05:55.870 --> 06:03.250
And let me say later on, we're going to be doing some experiments using prices of products.

06:03.250 --> 06:07.810
And one of the things we'd love to see is some sort of scrape of product data.

06:07.840 --> 06:15.850
And it turns out there is in fact, there are a bunch of repositories of data related to prices on Amazon.

06:15.850 --> 06:17.170
Here is some of them.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.220
You can have a look around the popularity of them and which ones are useful.

06:21.220 --> 06:26.380
We are in fact going to be using this one here, which is very recent and which is very comprehensive

06:26.380 --> 06:29.830
indeed and has tons of useful data.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.950
So it's absolutely phenomenal resource.

06:33.100 --> 06:40.390
So do take a look at this and you can you can also use things like data set viewers and other tools

06:40.390 --> 06:42.730
that come with the data sets.

06:42.760 --> 06:50.360
Part of the Huggingface hub spaces I mentioned is where Gradio radio apps and other kinds of apps can

06:50.360 --> 06:56.960
run to do things that people in the community want to show off to others, or just get to get people

06:56.960 --> 06:57.470
using them.

06:57.470 --> 07:02.600
And you can do the same with your hugging face apps or your radio apps.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.090
There's a lot of things to try out here.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.850
Uh, there's uh, there's sort of spaces of the week.

07:07.850 --> 07:12.230
There's there's things that are trending, and then there's a few types of spaces that we will be looking

07:12.230 --> 07:19.340
at a lot more in the next few or probably next week, mostly about leaderboards, comparing different

07:19.370 --> 07:20.240
LMS.

07:20.480 --> 07:28.760
Um, there's a plenty of fun spaces where you can try out different interesting LMS or generative AI

07:28.760 --> 07:29.870
applications.

07:30.140 --> 07:35.330
Um, one of the things I do tend to find is that sometimes because a lot of these are running for free

07:35.330 --> 07:41.120
on free boxes, it can be a bit flaky in that if it's a popular one, then it's overused and it's quite

07:41.120 --> 07:45.050
hard to get it to run because it will tell you that it's too busy right now.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.750
Um, but I think that comes with the territory of free software.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.150
When it does work, it is wonderful.

07:51.150 --> 07:54.870
So, for example, I just tried out a couple that were in the top spaces.

07:54.870 --> 08:02.850
So this one here, the AI Comic Factory, you can give it a style, you can give it a title of your

08:02.850 --> 08:08.340
comic and give it some something about how you want it to think when it's producing it.

08:08.490 --> 08:15.720
And I did a super powered data scientist comic, and you get this very cross looking, presumably the

08:15.720 --> 08:21.390
villain, and then you get presumably the heroine saying data is power, but sometimes it needs a little

08:21.390 --> 08:22.050
push.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.630
And so it's great fun.

08:24.630 --> 08:31.740
This is an imagined created comic strip based on a topic that you choose, and I encourage you to come

08:31.740 --> 08:32.700
in and give it a try.

08:32.700 --> 08:40.410
It did take me 2 or 3 tries before I got this because it was too much in demand, but it's for me.

08:40.410 --> 08:44.880
It's on the first page of Most Popular right now, but if you find this or something like it, give

08:44.880 --> 08:45.590
it a try.

08:45.620 --> 08:50.480
Another thing that I tried out that was available was this.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.650
This is pretty funny.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.360
You can upload an image of yourself.

08:53.360 --> 08:58.400
I chose the one with me in front of the plane from before, which I cannot fly.

08:58.790 --> 09:00.800
But that hasn't stopped me from trying.

09:01.190 --> 09:07.790
And then you can pick a garment or upload a garment, and then it will show you wearing that garment.

09:07.820 --> 09:08.810
I mean, it's all right.

09:08.810 --> 09:09.860
It's not perfect.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.030
I don't know what's happening.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.720
I'm sort of hunched up like this a bit, but it gives you the idea.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.760
It's interesting to see that some sort of strange artifact has happened with the plane behind me.

09:19.940 --> 09:23.570
Uh, but, um, aside from that, it's fun.

09:23.570 --> 09:29.900
It's free, it's easy to use, and it's a classic example of people having good ideas about fun things

09:29.900 --> 09:36.050
you can do with AI, with Llms, and have surfaced it for others to play with.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.590
You will find many examples of this on spaces.

09:40.190 --> 09:47.460
Uh, so then the other thing I wanted to show you, is to show you what happens if you go to to the

09:47.460 --> 09:49.260
avatar menu and look at yourself.

09:49.260 --> 09:54.390
So here is, um, the, uh, I'm just going to go straight here.

09:54.570 --> 09:57.360
Uh, I can see my own what I've done.

09:57.360 --> 10:03.330
I have one space, I've got a bunch of different models, some of which will be playing with ourselves,

10:03.330 --> 10:05.880
and I've got a bunch of data sets, and they're all private.

10:05.880 --> 10:10.530
You can make them private if you only want to have access to them, or public if you want the world

10:10.530 --> 10:11.400
to see them.

10:11.610 --> 10:17.250
Um, and I've got various data sets that we will be talking about many of these in the next few weeks,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.720
and I think you'll have fun with them.

10:19.080 --> 10:25.890
Uh, and this space that I've got, for example, I also will might refer to, um, just just as an

10:25.890 --> 10:28.350
example of how easy it is to do this stuff.

10:28.440 --> 10:37.050
But in this case, this is public and this is a game that I built which allows you to have llms compete

10:37.050 --> 10:39.540
against each other to try to battle.

10:39.540 --> 10:45.360
It was inspired by the the battle, the leadership battle we had in the first week.

10:45.510 --> 10:53.340
And I beefed that up a bit to make something where different lambs can fight in a way, to try and outwit

10:53.370 --> 10:57.390
each other and take money from each other, following some rules.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.340
And you can play a game and watch it run.

10:59.340 --> 11:04.980
Maybe we'll do that when we talk about the differences between lambs next week, I'll see if we have

11:04.980 --> 11:05.370
time.

11:05.370 --> 11:09.570
If not, by all means come and give this a try yourself to see how I've done, and you can see it as

11:09.570 --> 11:16.500
an example of how it's easy to take an LLM application with either a gradio front end.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.120
In this case, this is called Streamlit, a different kind of user interface or others.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.740
And then publish it to be available to everyone on huggingface spaces.

11:26.490 --> 11:33.300
One more thing about this menu that's worth mentioning is that if you go to your profile and your,

11:33.300 --> 11:40.840
uh, sorry, if you go to your settings, I mean, down here to settings, uh, down here is a section

11:40.840 --> 11:42.790
called Access Tokens.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.910
This is something you need to do if you haven't done it before.

11:45.940 --> 11:50.950
You go to access tokens and then there's a simple button create new token.

11:50.950 --> 11:58.060
You press that to give yourself a new token, a new API token, where you will ask for both read and

11:58.060 --> 11:59.230
write permissions.

11:59.230 --> 12:07.030
That is a token that we'll be using in Jupyter in order to get access to the hub, and in order to both

12:07.030 --> 12:09.970
download and upload models and data.

12:09.970 --> 12:14.260
So that is a key part of setting up your hugging face account.

12:14.350 --> 12:18.250
And that concludes our very quick tour of all things hugging face.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.990
There's so much to explore.

12:20.050 --> 12:22.420
The to do for you is now go in.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.650
If you haven't already, set up your account, set up your API key, it's all free.

12:26.650 --> 12:34.300
And then go hunt up models for datasets and look around some of the spaces and try out some of the cool

12:34.300 --> 12:37.990
products that people have made available for all of the community to try.

12:38.110 --> 12:39.220
Enjoy that.
