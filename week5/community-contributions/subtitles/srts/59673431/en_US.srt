00:00.950 --> 00:02.300
And here we have it.

00:02.300 --> 00:04.100
The user interface is completed.

00:04.100 --> 00:11.150
The extra notification came through on my phone and my watch, and you can see the wonderful trace of

00:11.150 --> 00:16.070
what went on here with the surfaced conclusion at the bottom.

00:16.280 --> 00:22.010
And it's actually just you just saw it up in the memory and it's just going off right now because it's

00:22.010 --> 00:24.560
kicking off another run while we speak.

00:24.590 --> 00:27.830
Uh, I left it too long, but there you got the idea.

00:27.830 --> 00:35.420
It ran, it completed, we saw the latest memories, and it was able to show the trace of the thinking

00:35.420 --> 00:37.220
that it was doing and what was happening.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.160
And it will be repeating this every five minutes.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.990
I should probably slow that down a bit.

00:42.110 --> 00:48.380
And notifying me all through the day and night of new deals.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.470
So hopefully this has been, uh, satisfying for you to see it come together.

00:54.470 --> 00:59.600
Hopefully you're running this yourself and seeing the same thing, seeing the conversation between the

00:59.600 --> 01:05.870
different agents in our agent framework and seeing this being surfaced and highlighted in this user

01:05.870 --> 01:13.250
interface, and seeing how easy, of course, how incredibly easy it is to use Gradio to build something

01:13.280 --> 01:21.200
off the shelf that is able to give us such great insights into what's going on and give us so much functionality,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.330
all in a set of screens.

01:23.330 --> 01:28.700
So with this, I hope that you enjoy working with this agent framework.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.960
Make it your own.

01:29.990 --> 01:35.960
I will probably go and fix the fact that the screen should refresh whilst it's also processing, so

01:35.960 --> 01:37.250
you don't have to to wait.

01:37.250 --> 01:42.410
But if I don't do it, then by all means you should do it yourself and add on more to this user interface

01:42.410 --> 01:43.820
and make this your own.

01:43.820 --> 01:50.720
Not only have you hopefully trained your own LLM to be even more accurate than R1, but also you're

01:50.720 --> 01:55.790
adding more functionality, improving the prompts, and finding other ways that we can bring this to

01:55.820 --> 02:00.290
life and also add add more features and surface them in the UI.

02:00.290 --> 02:06.200
And then when you've done that, push your code so that I can see it and admire it, and other students

02:06.230 --> 02:08.780
can take advantage of the changes that you've made.

02:08.990 --> 02:15.680
Enjoy working with this agent framework, and I will see you for the next video where we wrap things

02:15.680 --> 02:16.220
up.
