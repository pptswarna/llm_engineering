WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:00.500
Well.

00:00.530 --> 00:04.550
Hi there, this is time for PC people to get set up.

00:04.550 --> 00:08.060
So all you Mac people out there, you don't need to be watching this one.

00:08.060 --> 00:12.650
And now's the time when I tell you guys that I told the Mac people that they were my favorite people

00:12.680 --> 00:15.770
because I'm a mac user myself, but you know, I am a mac user.

00:15.770 --> 00:18.350
But I'll have you know that I started out in PCs.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.480
I in fact worked for IBM for a few years.

00:20.480 --> 00:25.790
So really, in my heart of hearts, I'm from a IBM from PC blood.

00:25.790 --> 00:26.150
So.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.290
So you guys are really my people no matter what I said to the other people.

00:30.290 --> 00:38.060
Anyways, let's get you set up with a PC to use the environment that we need for this entire course.

00:38.060 --> 00:46.640
So we start by going to the repository, my repository for this class, LM engineering, which is at

00:46.640 --> 00:50.060
github.com slash my name LM engineering.

00:50.060 --> 00:56.150
This link should be all over the place in the course and in the in the notes for the course and resources

00:56.150 --> 00:56.960
and so on.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.870
And when you go there, you see this repository on GitHub.

00:59.870 --> 01:05.440
And if you scroll down you get to see the Readme file that I've written with setup instructions, and

01:05.440 --> 01:11.020
I hope I've done a decent job in laying out all of the steps required to set up your environment.

01:11.050 --> 01:15.700
And if you prefer to follow instructions that way, then do it that way rather than watching the video.

01:15.730 --> 01:17.200
And hopefully I've done it well.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.550
And if you find a problem with them, please, please let me know so I can update them for everybody

01:21.550 --> 01:22.240
else.

01:22.570 --> 01:26.740
Anyway, if you do go through these instructions, what you'll find is that the first thing it says

01:26.770 --> 01:29.890
is that for PC people, you may need to install git.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.300
If you've not done it before.

01:31.300 --> 01:36.070
Git the code control system, something that I imagine most of you who have used some might not.

01:36.100 --> 01:40.480
It comes installed on Macs by default, but not on windows.

01:40.630 --> 01:47.230
And so if you follow this link, you get to the git download page, you follow the instructions to download,

01:47.500 --> 01:53.980
and you then have to say okay about 20 times and just accept the defaults for everything.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.750
I just went through and did this myself when I was pressing.

01:55.750 --> 02:00.310
Okay, okay, okay, so go through all of those things, just take the defaults all the way through

02:00.310 --> 02:03.490
and you will install git on your computer.

02:03.490 --> 02:07.360
And so once you have done that come back to the repository.

02:07.610 --> 02:12.560
The next thing to do is at the top here there's this green button code.

02:12.650 --> 02:17.540
And if you press that green button, it comes up here with the link to the repository.

02:17.540 --> 02:18.980
And you can pick either of these.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.020
But we were going to pick this https one.

02:21.020 --> 02:26.000
And we're going to press um actually you should pick this one and then press the copy button to copy

02:26.030 --> 02:27.500
it to clipboard.

02:27.770 --> 02:32.690
What we're now going to do is we're going to go and open a new PowerShell.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.100
Uh, let me see.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.720
Type PowerShell in here.

02:35.750 --> 02:39.530
I'm a little bit clumsy at the PC because it has been a little while since I've done this, so you may

02:39.530 --> 02:41.510
have to bear with me if I make a fool of myself.

02:41.510 --> 02:42.140
But there we go.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.640
Up comes the PowerShell.

02:43.910 --> 02:44.210
Um.

02:44.210 --> 02:49.910
And now the first thing you need to do, which you may already have, is create a projects directory,

02:49.910 --> 02:53.000
something that where your different projects that you work on will go.

02:53.030 --> 02:59.660
You may already have a projects directory, but if I do CD projects, it turns out I do not.

02:59.660 --> 03:03.200
So I can make a projects directory by doing this.

03:03.230 --> 03:06.050
You may also just use the Windows Explorer.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.420
Uh, the the File Explorer if you prefer.

03:08.450 --> 03:12.570
You don't need to use the command prompt, but, uh, is he doing that?

03:12.570 --> 03:15.900
So I've made a new projects directory in my home directory.

03:15.900 --> 03:22.410
I'm now going to CD into it, and here we are in our projects directory, which of course is empty or

03:22.410 --> 03:24.870
dir, if you prefer, the windows way.

03:25.050 --> 03:28.470
Uh, what I now type is very simple.

03:28.620 --> 03:35.730
Uh, it is git clone, uh, which means I want to make a local copy of this repository, and then you

03:35.730 --> 03:40.980
put in the name of the repository, the link to it that we copied a second ago.

03:41.310 --> 03:44.970
Uh, and when we do that, it will immediately download.

03:44.970 --> 03:45.780
It's already happened.

03:45.780 --> 03:48.480
All the code has been cloned to my local drive.

03:48.480 --> 03:54.120
So if I look here, you'll see that there is indeed a folder called LM engineering that we will now

03:54.150 --> 03:55.590
go into.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.600
And there is all of the code that will be our playground for the next eight weeks.

04:00.600 --> 04:08.220
And now it's worth mentioning that sometimes people use the expression the project root directory to

04:08.250 --> 04:10.650
mean this folder LM engineering.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.810
It is the root directory of this project.

04:12.810 --> 04:18.380
So if I ever say verbally, or if it's in the in the readme that it mentions project root.

04:18.380 --> 04:21.620
I'm talking about this directory LM engineering.

04:21.740 --> 04:22.550
There we are.

04:22.580 --> 04:29.150
So the next step is now to install Anaconda, which is as I say, it's a it's a reasonably heavyweight

04:29.180 --> 04:31.190
tool because it's super powerful.

04:31.430 --> 04:38.810
And the place to do that is back in the the Readme again, there is a link to where you go to install

04:38.900 --> 04:41.000
Anaconda and there it is.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.430
And I have that up over here.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.410
Um, except the cookies.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.450
This is the Anaconda documentation for installing on windows, and it tries to get you to give your

04:50.450 --> 04:53.600
email address and various other things which you can feel free to do if you wish.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.590
But then at the end, you can also just say what we'll do now press the download.

04:57.590 --> 05:02.360
It suggests you could you could provide an email, but you can also just say skip registration here

05:02.360 --> 05:03.140
if you'd prefer.

05:03.140 --> 05:06.080
And then you get to this Download Now page.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.420
And this is the download that we will do now.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.550
Anaconda is quite large.

05:10.550 --> 05:13.670
This is a five gigabyte download.

05:13.820 --> 05:16.730
And so it may be something which you don't have the room for.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.740
And you may also find that this is too heavy weight.

05:18.740 --> 05:24.560
And there is the alternative approach using virtualenv that I will record after this, which is a simpler

05:24.560 --> 05:27.290
approach, but it's less guaranteed to be compatible.

05:27.350 --> 05:28.790
And, you know, it's less hardcore.

05:28.790 --> 05:32.930
If you want to be a hardcore LM engineer, you should at least try the Anaconda route.

05:32.930 --> 05:36.800
So you press the download button, which I already did.

05:36.830 --> 05:43.520
It then brings up a screen to install Anaconda, the usual installation wizard thing, and you have

05:43.520 --> 05:44.930
to press yes a few times.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.300
It does prompt you for where you want it to install.

05:47.330 --> 05:53.750
Some people have selected there to install it to a different drive to make sure that you have capacity.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.310
Um, and then when that is done, it will complete the installation, take a few minutes to download

05:58.310 --> 06:03.590
and install, and you will have the Anaconda program on your computer.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.850
And what does that mean?

06:04.850 --> 06:10.040
Well, the thing that it means, as far as we're concerned is that whilst we have this PowerShell that

06:10.040 --> 06:17.300
we are very familiar with, there is also a new thing on our start menu, which is called Anaconda PowerShell

06:17.300 --> 06:22.780
and that if we open it looks very similar, looks just like a normal PowerShell, but it is in fact

06:22.780 --> 06:25.030
a special Anaconda one.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.860
Try and expand this window for you.

06:26.890 --> 06:29.740
Hold on a second while I fumble fumble, fumble.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.450
Uh uh.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.350
Now what have I done?

06:32.380 --> 06:33.250
There we go.

06:33.580 --> 06:34.630
I'm hopeless at this.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.590
There we go.

06:35.620 --> 06:42.490
So the way that you know that it's an Anaconda PowerShell is that this word base appears to the left,

06:42.490 --> 06:48.070
which means that we are in a world, uh, a base world, rather than in a world that we have built,

06:48.070 --> 06:49.900
especially for an environment.

06:50.020 --> 06:50.680
All right.

06:50.680 --> 06:57.640
So now I'm going to go into our projects folder that we just made, and I'm going to go into LM engineering.

06:57.670 --> 06:58.570
There it is.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.880
So we're now in the project root directory as I explained is the right term for it.

07:03.910 --> 07:10.600
And I'm now going to run a simple command which is conda which is the name for running anaconda commands.

07:10.660 --> 07:13.390
Env which means environment create.

07:13.390 --> 07:19.810
I want to create a new environment minus f means I'm going to specify a file which describes exactly

07:19.810 --> 07:21.940
everything that I need for this environment.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.920
And the file is called Environment.

07:23.950 --> 07:25.450
Environment.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.650
Dot YAML.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.080
And you can see Environment.yml right right here.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.810
So that is what I'm going to do.

07:32.170 --> 07:39.580
Now at this point you will need to go and get a coffee and maybe even two coffees.

07:39.700 --> 07:45.670
So it does take a bit of time to install this full environment the first time.

07:45.670 --> 07:50.950
So when I do it, it's probably takes a few minutes because I've done it before.

07:50.980 --> 07:56.950
The very first time, it might take somewhere between 10 minutes and 20 minutes depending on your internet

07:56.950 --> 08:00.520
connection, and that's going to be a thing to look out for.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.260
So what it's actually doing.

08:02.260 --> 08:08.380
So it's looking at all of the packages that we say that we need for this data science environment.

08:08.380 --> 08:15.520
And it then figures out for this particular type of system, whatever chip you've got and for the various

08:15.520 --> 08:21.400
configurations that you've got, what are the compatible versions of every single package that we need

08:21.430 --> 08:26.050
to do things like in the future we'll have an object database, we'll be using Lang chain, we'll be

08:26.050 --> 08:28.590
using gradio all sorts of things.

08:28.590 --> 08:35.010
It makes sure that we pick the latest versions that are all compatible with each other and also compatible

08:35.010 --> 08:36.810
with your processor and so on.

08:36.810 --> 08:39.240
And that's why it now says solving environment.

08:39.240 --> 08:45.330
That's the equation that it's solving with lots of different decisions to make.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.360
So it's going to make those decisions.

08:48.360 --> 08:53.790
And it's then going to install all of those packages on your computer.

08:53.940 --> 08:58.140
And we're going to I'm going to keep keep going with this sentence for a bit longer to see if it's going

08:58.140 --> 08:59.820
to get close to wrapping up.

08:59.970 --> 09:04.890
Otherwise I might have to, uh, to to break and come back in just a second.

09:06.300 --> 09:06.690
All right.

09:06.690 --> 09:08.820
It looks like it's going to take just a couple more minutes.

09:08.820 --> 09:13.140
So I'm going to pause the video and I will return when this is ready.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.690
Well it's just as well I didn't hang on in there.

09:15.690 --> 09:18.630
It took another five minutes from that point to finish.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.790
So that would've been an embarrassing amount of five minutes of my waffle that I've rescued you from.

09:23.940 --> 09:28.140
So anyway, this can take a few minutes and I've got a fast connection, as I say, so.

09:28.140 --> 09:31.250
So it could well be 20 30 minutes for you.

09:31.340 --> 09:32.870
So hang on in there.

09:32.870 --> 09:37.880
But but obviously if it takes unspeakably long, then abandon and go to the next video where we will

09:37.880 --> 09:38.660
do it differently.

09:38.660 --> 09:44.120
But if it's completed, your your Anaconda PowerShell prompt should look something like this.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.490
It still says base at the end there.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.620
And we've created an environment that is known.

09:48.650 --> 09:49.880
It's called LMS.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.110
That's the name I gave it.

09:51.110 --> 09:59.000
And to now activate that environment, which means to make that be the live world that that Anaconda

09:59.000 --> 10:00.020
is working within.

10:00.050 --> 10:05.480
You simply type conda, activate LMS and you'll need to run that.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.370
You'll need to any time that you come back to your computer that you want to start everything again

10:10.520 --> 10:16.550
before you you get started, you will need to remember to open up an anaconda prompt and do conda.

10:16.580 --> 10:23.390
Activate LMS and your clue that it is now working is that you'll see LMS written over here on the left

10:23.540 --> 10:30.770
to the left of my prompt, and that is telling me that I have successfully created my Anaconda environment.

10:30.890 --> 10:37.050
Um, and another way we can do it is that if we type Python minus minus version, it will tell us that

10:37.050 --> 10:43.290
the version of Python we're on is 3.11.1, which is the version, or at least 3.11 is what I specified

10:43.290 --> 10:44.220
for this environment.

10:44.220 --> 10:49.500
So we know that we're on exactly the same version of Python, and everything should be compatible.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.670
And it just remains for me to type these two words Jupyter Lab.

10:53.670 --> 10:58.860
And this is going to open up the Jupyter environment, which is this data science environment where

10:58.860 --> 11:02.280
we can work really effectively together on code.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.290
Again, some of you probably know this back to front.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.940
For some people this might be new.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.050
I press enter.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.630
It's going to start Jupyter Lab.

11:09.810 --> 11:11.490
Uh, up it comes.

11:11.880 --> 11:17.310
The first time it might prompt you for which browser do you want to open, but then it opens up with

11:17.310 --> 11:26.190
Jupyter Lab on my computer with our eight weeks that lies ahead of us and we are good to go.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.410
That is the PC instructions.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.060
Hopefully this has all gone well for you.

11:30.060 --> 11:35.520
If it hasn't, please, please reach out to me, let me know and I will get you sorted.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.800
I will see you then for the next video.
