00:00.860 --> 00:05.810
Well, they say that time flies when you're having fun, and it certainly feels like time is flying.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.120
Uh, hopefully for you as well as for me.

00:08.270 --> 00:11.150
Uh, you have reached the 20% milestone.

00:11.150 --> 00:18.170
You were a fifth of the way towards being an expert in all things LMN, and I hope that it feels that

00:18.170 --> 00:18.380
way.

00:18.380 --> 00:23.420
I hope you're feeling the the sense of accomplishment and the way that you are leveling up.

00:23.420 --> 00:28.580
Every time we get to these summary pages and think about all of the new skills you've acquired.

00:28.580 --> 00:32.870
So to recap them, I know I keep doing this, but I do think it's important.

00:32.900 --> 00:39.980
You can of course describe transformers and tokens and contacts, windows and API prices and all of

00:40.010 --> 00:40.670
that.

00:40.940 --> 00:48.200
You can code now pretty confidently, I would say with the different APIs for the frontier models that

00:48.200 --> 00:54.710
you know well, and you can build an AI chatbot assistant, including an interactive UI.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.150
And I promise you it would be easy.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.410
And it was easy.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.190
You hopefully you weren't expecting it to be quite as easy as it was.

01:01.190 --> 01:04.010
The one line of code is insane.

01:04.100 --> 01:09.080
Uh, that is the, uh, the the wonder, the magic of Gradio.

01:09.110 --> 01:17.630
So next time we change subject to something called tools, which is a particularly interesting capability.

01:17.630 --> 01:26.450
It's it allows us to give LMS powers to do something, to run some functionality that we will arm it

01:26.450 --> 01:33.470
with so we can write some code, and then we can give the arm the ability to, to use it.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.630
Now that might sound a bit spooky.

01:35.660 --> 01:40.730
We're actually going to build something and then sort of give the LMS powers to to to do it.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.770
What to like run code on our box.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.810
We're going to let them do that.

01:44.990 --> 01:51.110
Um, and unfortunately, I will warn you, this is one of those things that that sounds very magical.

01:51.110 --> 01:54.590
And then a bit like the wizard behind the curtain.

01:54.590 --> 02:00.140
Uh, when you find out what this actually means, it's a little bit less magical when you know the ingredients

02:00.140 --> 02:02.930
to the incredible, uh, dish.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.810
Suddenly, uh, you think, is that all?

02:06.590 --> 02:12.770
But for the moment, you can you can live in awe of the fact that next time we are going to empower,

02:12.800 --> 02:21.040
uh, frontier model with the ability to run code on our box, which is going to do things, uh, and

02:21.190 --> 02:26.380
I'm going to reveal the, the secret sauce behind that.

02:26.530 --> 02:31.570
And then perhaps it won't be quite as mysterious as it sounds, but I'm excited to take you through

02:31.570 --> 02:31.960
that.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.840
That's what we're doing next time, and I will see you then.
