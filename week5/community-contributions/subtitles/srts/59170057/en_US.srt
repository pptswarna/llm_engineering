00:00.530 --> 00:05.750
And so at the beginning of this week, we started by talking about hugging face pipelines.

00:05.750 --> 00:08.750
And you used all the different pipeline.

00:08.750 --> 00:13.130
Not actually not all of them, because there's so many, but we use many of the most common pipelines

00:13.130 --> 00:15.980
to do every day inference tasks.

00:15.980 --> 00:23.000
And now today we looked at Tokenizers and you are well versed in Tokenizers, and hopefully a lot has

00:23.000 --> 00:27.560
come together in terms of your understanding of what they mean and how they work, and special tokens

00:27.560 --> 00:29.060
and all the like.

00:29.150 --> 00:37.760
So next time, next time we start to work with models and this is when we can use the underlying hugging

00:37.790 --> 00:44.870
face code that is a wrapper around PyTorch or TensorFlow code to generate text and compare the results

00:44.870 --> 00:48.170
across multiple open source models.

00:48.170 --> 00:51.590
And that's going to be a ton of fun and I'm looking forward to it.
