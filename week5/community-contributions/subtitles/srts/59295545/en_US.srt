00:00.350 --> 00:02.270
I really hope you've enjoyed this week.

00:02.270 --> 00:03.800
We've got tons done.

00:03.800 --> 00:10.190
We've experimented with all sorts of new techniques and models, and hopefully you've learned a ton

00:10.190 --> 00:11.120
through it all.

00:11.270 --> 00:17.660
Uh, at this point, not only can you code frontier models, including AI assistants, not only can

00:17.660 --> 00:24.770
you choose the right model for your project backed by metrics from leaderboards arenas, but also you

00:24.770 --> 00:30.980
can use frontier and open source models to generate code and as an extra little tool to to add to your

00:30.980 --> 00:31.640
tool belt.

00:31.670 --> 00:41.750
You are also able to deploy models as inference endpoints using Hugging Face's inference endpoint functionality.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.470
So congratulations on all of these skills.

00:45.620 --> 00:51.440
Uh, and uh, perhaps, like me, you're slightly disappointed that open source didn't quite measure

00:51.440 --> 00:54.080
up, but it did a fine job.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.280
We had great fun with it.

00:55.280 --> 01:02.690
And for many tasks of optimizing Python to C plus plus, you would find that Codex would do great.

01:02.750 --> 01:10.250
Um, but when it comes down to it, uh, putting a 7 billion parameter model up against a much more

01:10.280 --> 01:17.810
than 1.76 trillion parameter model, that was GPT four and GPT four and Claude 3.5 sonnet are considered

01:17.810 --> 01:19.070
to be much bigger.

01:19.070 --> 01:22.880
Uh, so it wasn't a particularly fair match.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.580
And in the circumstances, I think Codex did very well indeed.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.940
Next time you're going to be comparing open source and closed source models, performance, talking

01:34.940 --> 01:42.710
about different commercial use cases for code generation, and being able to build solutions that use

01:42.710 --> 01:46.760
this kind of code generation technique for all sorts of tasks.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.840
Uh, looking forward to it.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.710
I'll see you then.
