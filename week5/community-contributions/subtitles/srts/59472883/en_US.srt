00:01.490 --> 00:03.500
Okay, time to reveal the results.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.880
It has run to completion.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.010
And here it is.

00:07.940 --> 00:11.060
So a moment to pause.

00:11.090 --> 00:19.040
It turns out that it's actually a little bit worse than the previous results before fine tuning.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.560
Um, I would expect that.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.690
It's just that it's very similar.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.510
It's not actually that the model has gotten any worse.

00:26.510 --> 00:32.960
I would suspect that fine tuning in this case has not helped us, which is obviously disappointing.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.520
I did warn you at the beginning that there would be a disappointment in this session.

00:37.730 --> 00:42.290
Uh, now, having said that, there are some things that it's definitely improved upon.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.770
Unfortunately, they're not reflected in this business metric.

00:45.890 --> 00:50.810
Uh, but it has improved in terms of the, the, the biggest outliers.

00:50.810 --> 00:56.000
I don't know if you remember, but when we ran it before, it was guessing some things that were way

00:56.000 --> 00:57.980
outside the range of a thousand.

00:58.010 --> 01:02.150
I think I showed you there were points like that were far, far too high.

01:02.150 --> 01:08.960
And from seeing our data set of 500, it's it's appreciated that there aren't things that are priced

01:08.960 --> 01:09.860
that much.

01:09.860 --> 01:14.750
And so that has caused something of a, of a nuanced correction to what it's doing.

01:14.780 --> 01:18.110
But other than that it hasn't particularly helped it.

01:18.110 --> 01:23.780
And in fact, unfortunately with this set, this this test set, at least it's actually appears to have

01:23.780 --> 01:30.170
hindered it according to this business metric, the one that we're really focused on, the total difference.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.500
So that's a sobering moment for us.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.120
Uh, and uh, in the next video, I'll explain why.

01:38.120 --> 01:43.040
And the times when fine tuning frontier models can be very helpful and when they can't.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.060
And fear not, there is, there is, there is good news ahead.

01:47.060 --> 01:51.260
Even if this is a is a setback for us, we will we will see more.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.130
See you next time.
