00:00.680 --> 00:05.210
Welcome back to an action packed time of of training.

00:05.210 --> 00:13.880
So now, after waiting about five minutes when I run this same, uh, list events function, we get

00:13.880 --> 00:16.100
to see lots of things going on.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.520
What you see in the last ten events is that training is happening.

00:19.520 --> 00:26.240
And you can see in this message the step zero, step one, step two, step three out of 500, representing

00:26.240 --> 00:30.380
the 500 different training data points that it's going to go through.

00:30.380 --> 00:32.750
And you'll also see here training loss.

00:32.780 --> 00:39.500
Training loss is something that we want to come down and that will show us, uh, a good outcome, which

00:39.500 --> 00:41.660
is of course, what we're going for.

00:41.660 --> 00:49.820
And every time if I rerun this, we'll see now that it's already on step 118 as we go now, it's kind

00:49.820 --> 00:51.440
of hard to see what's going on here.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.970
And so this would be this would be a bit challenging if this is what we had to put up with.

00:55.970 --> 01:02.990
But we don't because we use weights and biases and here, here is our gorgeous weights and biases screen

01:02.990 --> 01:06.440
which allows us to follow along with the training.

01:06.770 --> 01:12.290
And what we can see is the the results of training loss and watch what's happening.

01:12.290 --> 01:14.900
It's just updated because the page was refreshing.

01:15.110 --> 01:18.980
Um, and we'll get to see and get some insight into what's going on.

01:18.980 --> 01:25.100
Now, one thing that you'll always see when you're running this kind of training is that the first few

01:25.100 --> 01:28.430
batch steps will typically show a dramatic drop.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.590
Um, and that's actually not necessarily something to get too excited about.

01:33.620 --> 01:39.770
Typically, what's happening there is that the model is very quickly, uh, learning, um, the very

01:39.770 --> 01:44.780
much the parts of the structure which almost go without saying, like the fact that there's a dollar

01:44.780 --> 01:52.250
sign, um, and uh, and where to put the decimal point and a few other things that, that, um, I

01:52.250 --> 01:58.400
think in this case, it realizes that just guessing zero zero for the sense is more likely than, than

01:58.400 --> 02:02.930
anything else to be the right number of cents, because there's many things that are just a whole number

02:02.930 --> 02:03.590
of dollars.

02:03.590 --> 02:09.590
So there's this is that's total speculation, but it's things like that, the kind of obvious stuff

02:09.590 --> 02:16.740
about the construct that allows training to to come down very quickly for the first few steps to get

02:16.740 --> 02:21.390
the obvious stuff out of the way, so that it's now following a decent pattern.

02:21.420 --> 02:28.290
What you're really looking for is continual progress from that point, and you typically, if you've

02:28.290 --> 02:32.430
got a training set up well and there's no right or wrong answers here.

02:32.430 --> 02:35.250
So so there's exceptions to everything I'm saying now.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.460
But but generally speaking you do want to see some variation.

02:38.460 --> 02:45.300
It's good to see some some batch steps that have greater and lower loss because you are you're trying

02:45.300 --> 02:49.230
to optimize and you're looking to explore different, different possibilities.

02:49.440 --> 02:57.000
Um, and what you're trying to what you're looking for is a kind of trend where over time, whilst any

02:57.000 --> 03:04.980
individual batch step may go up or down, you do expect or hope to see a gradual decrease in loss,

03:05.250 --> 03:14.070
um, over time and as potentially a slight concern for us that might make us a bit worried, is that

03:14.070 --> 03:18.310
we're seeing something where this doesn't particularly seem to be coming down.

03:18.310 --> 03:25.300
It just seems to show a lot of volatility, um, representing the fact that some of the of the data

03:25.300 --> 03:28.840
points are doing better than others in terms of the the guessing.

03:28.840 --> 03:35.770
But it's not as if there seems to be much of an improving trend or a trend in any direction yet.

03:36.070 --> 03:39.310
Um, at least that's what appears to be the case.

03:39.490 --> 03:45.970
So hopefully you are also running this, and you're going to be watching carefully to see what happens.

03:45.970 --> 03:50.860
Uh, it's going to take a total, I think, of about 10 or 15 minutes to run all the way through, but

03:50.860 --> 03:53.290
let's see where it is now in this list.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.130
We're now about halfway through.

03:57.160 --> 04:02.890
When it gets to the end, there's going to be a pause while it goes through a step of validating the

04:02.890 --> 04:09.100
results and and and some, some confirmation checks on the OpenAI side that it that it tells you about

04:09.100 --> 04:10.840
in the, in the statuses.

04:10.930 --> 04:16.690
Um, and then you actually get an email to tell you that it's completed at the same time as this run

04:16.690 --> 04:17.260
completes.

04:17.260 --> 04:20.560
And when we pick up in the next video, it will have run.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.760
I will see you there.
