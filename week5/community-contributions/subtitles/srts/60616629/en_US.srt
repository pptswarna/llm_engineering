WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:05.030
And welcome back to team PC and Team Mac as we come back together again for a quick video.

00:05.030 --> 00:07.640
In this one, I'm just going to quickly walk through what you do.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.990
If Anaconda has given you problems, you're not able to get that to work and you want to fall back to

00:12.020 --> 00:14.300
the simpler virtualenv approach.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.820
This is a quicker, simpler approach.

00:16.820 --> 00:19.160
It's less guaranteed to be compatible.

00:19.160 --> 00:24.020
It's less heavyweight and powerful than the Anaconda environment, but it's perfectly okay.

00:24.020 --> 00:27.020
And so by all means, use this if you would prefer.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.000
So I'm going to do it on my Mac.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.680
But I'll point out when things are different for the PC and it's basically the same, although I'll

00:33.680 --> 00:40.190
say the the instructions begin where it says alternative setup instructions in the Readme on on the,

00:40.190 --> 00:41.360
the, the repo.

00:41.360 --> 00:47.930
And one important difference between PC and Mac is that if you haven't, I imagine that that almost

00:47.930 --> 00:51.680
everyone on this has has installed Python before on their PC.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.050
But if you haven't, then you will need to do that.

00:54.260 --> 01:01.790
Python comes on Macs by default, but not on PCs, so I've got a link in here to go to the Python website.

01:01.820 --> 01:07.080
When you go to the Python download website, you can choose to download the latest version of Python,

01:07.080 --> 01:14.970
but it might be better to choose Python 3.11.9, which is the latest version 3.11 to be compatible,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.940
and you can come down here and do a windows installer to install on windows.

01:20.970 --> 01:25.890
And if you don't have this version and if you have the time to install this version on windows, that

01:25.890 --> 01:27.060
would be better.

01:27.210 --> 01:27.990
Okay.

01:28.020 --> 01:33.060
Once you have done that, then on a mac, bring up a terminal window on the PC.

01:33.090 --> 01:39.270
Bring up a normal PowerShell prompt, not the Anaconda prompt, just a regular prompt, and go into

01:39.270 --> 01:45.780
the projects directory that we created earlier and then into the LM Engineering directory where the

01:45.780 --> 01:47.220
project sits.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.980
And now you do a simple command.

01:50.340 --> 01:55.110
Let's first just quickly check what version of Python we're running Python minus minus version.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.730
And on my computer my default version is actually 3.12.3.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.200
It still works as far as I can tell for everything, but it's not as guaranteed to be compatible.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.480
But still, I'm going to push ahead with this.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.800
Uh, and what we now do is we type Python minus m.

02:11.410 --> 02:13.450
Venv venv.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.280
You might wonder what magic, what strange concoction that is.

02:18.490 --> 02:24.100
Python is saying I want to create a new virtual environment, and then the name of that virtual environment

02:24.100 --> 02:28.210
is going to be Venv again, which is something that people usually often use.

02:28.210 --> 02:34.180
And if I look in this directory, you'll see that there is now a folder called Venv virtual environment,

02:34.180 --> 02:37.750
which will contain all of the Python files for this virtual environment.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.480
And so far everything has been the same with a PC.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.960
What I'm going to do now is different between a mac and a PC.

02:44.170 --> 02:49.510
On a mac, what we're going to do is activate this virtual environment on a mac.

02:49.540 --> 02:55.840
You do that by typing source venv slash bin slash, activate.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.830
And again, all of this is of course I just did that.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.260
All of this is of course written in the Readme instructions.

03:02.260 --> 03:06.970
And the way we know we've activated the environment is that Venv appears over here on the left.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.590
You can see there's also this base here because I've got Anaconda installed.

03:11.590 --> 03:16.180
You may not see that if you haven't installed Anaconda and on a PC you won't, you won't see that.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.300
but that can be safely ignored.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.620
We are in the venv.

03:19.650 --> 03:20.610
Environment.

03:21.030 --> 03:25.740
And now what you do, which is something that probably most of you have done many times before, is

03:25.770 --> 03:29.610
we do pip install because we want to install Python packages.

03:29.610 --> 03:37.500
Minus R means we have a file of names of packages that we want to specify, and it's called requirements.txt.

03:38.340 --> 03:42.630
And then when I press enter it is now going to be installing these packages.

03:42.630 --> 03:48.210
But it's not installing them on my the python that comes with my box.

03:48.210 --> 03:52.560
It's installing them specifically on this virtual environment called Venv.

03:52.560 --> 03:59.130
So I'm isolating my environment from anything else that I might be doing on my computer with Python.

03:59.340 --> 04:04.110
And you can see that there's plenty going on here as it does all of these things.

04:04.140 --> 04:07.890
It will be slower for you because you can see it's saying it's used cached.

04:08.070 --> 04:12.780
Because I've done this before, it won't be cached for you presumably.

04:12.780 --> 04:18.540
So there'll be a lot of downloading going on, but it's still a lot quicker than setting up the Anaconda,

04:18.570 --> 04:19.920
uh, window.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.720
And then the business happens at the end.

04:22.750 --> 04:28.990
Right now it is at the moment, now going ahead and installing all of that.

04:29.020 --> 04:32.290
And you can see a lot of different packages here.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.400
Uh, of course, only some of these are the packages we're actually going to use on this course.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.920
Many of them are things on which they depend.

04:38.950 --> 04:43.690
So it's installed both the packages we need and all of their dependencies up there.

04:43.750 --> 04:48.280
Um, but you'll see that there's things like SQL alchemy, and that's because we're going to be using

04:48.280 --> 04:51.430
an object database that's going to depend on that.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.680
Um, and you can see other things going on here.

04:53.680 --> 05:00.220
Chroma is the the vector data store, a wonderful open source vector data store that we'll be using

05:00.310 --> 05:04.150
Tokenizers part of our Huggingface code.

05:04.360 --> 05:10.780
So lots of things you can take your time while it's doing this, to look around and see the names of

05:10.810 --> 05:12.730
some of the packages that we will be using.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.360
All right.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.800
That has now happened.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.660
And it didn't take very long at all.

05:16.660 --> 05:22.630
And at the end of this, all I have to now do is again, uh oh, I might just quickly mention that the

05:22.630 --> 05:32.730
the command for a PC to activate your environment is in fact venv and then backslash scripts.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.890
Backslash activate.

05:34.920 --> 05:41.520
So you would type that first and then you would type the pip install r requirements.txt.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.010
And of course that's all specified in the readme.

05:44.430 --> 05:50.880
But whether you're on a mac or on a PC at this point all you would do is type the simple JupyterLab.

05:50.880 --> 05:57.870
And with any luck, when I press enter, it is now going to launch the JupyterLab environment.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.040
Here it comes.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.000
And this is going to be our home for the next few weeks.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.020
The next eight weeks.

06:04.020 --> 06:07.710
Folders for each of the eight weeks and the usual setup.

06:07.710 --> 06:12.270
The only difference being now we have this Venv folder which contains our virtual environment.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.630
So that's the fallback plan.

06:15.630 --> 06:16.530
I hope that makes sense.

06:16.530 --> 06:21.990
If you have any problems at all with the fallback plan, then please, please, please reach out.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.950
I will fix it.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.080
We'll get you on your way quickly.

06:25.110 --> 06:31.590
All right, on to the next video when we're going to be doing setting up API keys with OpenAI.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.430
See you there.
