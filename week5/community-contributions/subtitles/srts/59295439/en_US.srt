00:01.040 --> 00:05.300
So I'm aware that there's a big risk that you are getting fed up of leaderboards, because we've done

00:05.300 --> 00:11.000
a lot of talking about leaderboards, and perhaps you are becoming fatigued to looking at benchmarks

00:11.000 --> 00:12.020
and leaderboards.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.010
You've bookmarked them all.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.780
You're thinking, okay, I get it.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.110
There are lots of great resources when it comes to choosing an LMS.

00:18.110 --> 00:21.590
I will look through your leaderboards and I will do it then.

00:21.590 --> 00:22.280
But enough.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.390
Enough with the leaderboards.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.400
But wait, there is one more.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.480
And it's a really fun one.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.770
And it's one you're going to love.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.390
So you're not going to mind this final leaderboard for us to look at.

00:32.390 --> 00:35.240
And it is in fact not a normal leaderboard.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.810
It is an arena and it's called the LMS Chatbot Arena.

00:38.810 --> 00:43.550
And you may have come across this already because it's so popular and fun and lots of people talk about

00:43.550 --> 00:43.820
it.

00:43.820 --> 00:48.860
So if you know it already, then hang on, bear with me because we're going to use it together and have

00:48.860 --> 00:49.610
some fun.

00:49.610 --> 00:57.290
So the idea is that the LMS chatbot arena, which is incredibly popular, is a place where models are

00:57.290 --> 01:02.030
assessed by humans and they're assessed for their chat abilities.

01:02.090 --> 01:05.830
It is, as they say, a crowdsourced open platform.

01:05.830 --> 01:15.760
They've collected over a million human votes, ranking llms and to display results in as as I say,

01:15.790 --> 01:20.440
in what's called an Elo rating type that will be familiar to chess players.

01:20.440 --> 01:28.360
It's a way of assessing an overall kind of leaderboard based on the outcomes of head to head battles.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.410
And you can see here some of the results.

01:32.710 --> 01:43.570
And we will now take a look at what we see in first place is a variant of GPT four called ChatGPT 4.0

01:43.600 --> 01:45.640
that came out very recently.

01:45.640 --> 01:54.820
As of recording this video, it came out in early August 2024, and that previously GPT four was a little

01:54.850 --> 01:56.170
bit further down on this list.

01:56.170 --> 02:05.470
But with this latest trained, fine tuned model, uh ChatGPT four has taken the top position in the

02:05.470 --> 02:10.490
arena with an Elo of 1.316.

02:10.700 --> 02:11.270
Uh.

02:11.420 --> 02:16.400
A useful thing here is that the knowledge cut off is quoted over on the right.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.210
And so it's a if you want one place to go to see all the knowledge cut offs.

02:20.240 --> 02:26.180
Actually, the, uh, open the LMS chatbot arena is a good place to go, so that's worth knowing.

02:26.210 --> 02:30.860
I don't think it's it's intended to be its primary reason, but it's a useful tidbit.

02:31.490 --> 02:39.770
Um, you'll see that Gemini 1.5 Pro actually is is doing really well in this human evaluated assessment.

02:40.040 --> 02:49.730
Um, grok two, which is the latest model from X, uh, formerly known as Twitter is in strong place

02:49.730 --> 02:50.600
here.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.430
Uh, grok one had not done so well.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.860
Grok two is really doing very well.

02:55.250 --> 03:01.220
Um, and it's beating the earlier GPT four zero from, from May.

03:01.610 --> 03:05.410
Um, and uh, it's, uh, yeah.

03:05.410 --> 03:10.310
Uh, and you can see there's not much in that ELO difference, but at this point there is fairly significant

03:10.550 --> 03:17.720
difference from the the leader Claude 3.5 Sonet, which at one point was was the front runner by by

03:17.750 --> 03:26.240
I think by quite a way, if I remember right when it came out has now come down to, uh, I guess equal,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.650
equal sixth or so.

03:27.650 --> 03:38.450
Um, uh, right down here in, in, uh, Elo of 1270 compared to 1316 for the top, uh, GPT chat,

03:38.450 --> 03:44.930
GPT four zero, um, then Gemini 1.5 flash, which of course is a somewhat smaller model.

03:44.930 --> 03:52.610
And here comes llama 3.1 405 billion at 1266.

03:52.820 --> 03:57.140
Uh, so, uh, yeah, very interesting to see this lineup.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.840
You can keep going to find your favorite models.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.570
Claude three opus is way down here.

04:02.780 --> 04:11.810
Uh, and, uh, yeah, this is a great place to get a sense of how humans consider the experience of

04:11.820 --> 04:17.550
chatting with different, uh, instruction tuned uh, chatbots.

04:17.580 --> 04:23.400
Uh, you'll see that, uh, um, command r that we were looking at before.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.120
Uh, I just saw command R that features somewhere here.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.810
Uh, you will have to find that yourself.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.310
I've now lost it.

04:32.310 --> 04:32.940
There it is.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.830
Command R plus found it.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.680
Uh, there it is at 1213.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.760
Uh, it's one of the ones we looked at all the way back at the start in week one.

04:41.940 --> 04:51.210
So this is the famous LM, uh, LMS chatbot arena, and you can vote by clicking on this link, and

04:51.210 --> 04:53.910
it will bring up this voting screen.

04:53.910 --> 04:55.290
And here's how it works.

04:55.290 --> 04:58.620
You get presented with two models model A and model B.

04:58.650 --> 05:02.160
You don't know which one is which and you have to chat with them both.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.910
And so let's do one of our favorite little chat things.

05:05.940 --> 05:19.930
Uh, please tell me a light hearted light hearted joke suitable for a room full of data scientists.

05:19.930 --> 05:26.920
So this question will be asked to both models together and we will see how they answer.

05:26.950 --> 05:31.990
So the model A why do the data scientists break up with a computer?

05:31.990 --> 05:37.270
Because it had too many commitment issues with its null values.

05:37.660 --> 05:43.480
Okay, they did sciency, but not funny, I don't think.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.860
Maybe you found it funny.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.200
And model B, please tell me a joke.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.310
Here is a light hearted joke.

05:48.310 --> 05:49.990
Why does scientists go to the library?

05:49.990 --> 05:52.720
Because they heard it had a lot of volumes.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.670
Oh, yeah, that's pretty good, right?

05:54.670 --> 05:58.030
That's that's different plays on the dual meaning word volumes.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.050
It gives a little explanation.

05:59.080 --> 05:59.770
The joke is simple.

05:59.770 --> 06:04.540
It's kind of pun that data scientists tend to appreciate as it combines technical expertise with a bit

06:04.540 --> 06:05.410
of wordplay.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.790
I think that's solid.

06:06.790 --> 06:07.900
That's solid.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.630
Uh, I think B is better, is what I want to go with.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.310
Hopefully you agree with me.

06:12.340 --> 06:17.560
Uh, if not, you need to go into the arena and do, uh, do a ask a similar question and make your

06:17.560 --> 06:23.570
own vote, but I'm going to vote on your behalf on all of our behalves by pressing the B is better button,

06:23.570 --> 06:25.730
and it will then reveal the models.

06:25.730 --> 06:26.600
Let's see.

06:26.900 --> 06:34.490
Uh, interestingly, the we picked Claude three haiku and we picked that against grok two.

06:34.610 --> 06:39.740
Uh, if I remember right, grok two was quite significantly higher than Claude three haiku.

06:39.740 --> 06:45.050
So we have slightly fractionally shifted that balance through our vote.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.030
So I hope you enjoyed that.

06:47.060 --> 06:52.130
Of course, that was somewhat unscientific, but the idea is it's meant to be a human decision based

06:52.130 --> 06:53.690
on your interaction.

06:53.900 --> 06:57.260
And the ask for you now is go and do this.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.270
It's an important way to add back to the community.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.980
It is data that will be used.

07:01.010 --> 07:03.020
Uh, plus it's a it's a lot of fun.

07:03.050 --> 07:09.620
Uh, and it gives you a bit of sense of the capabilities and scope of the different models and some

07:09.620 --> 07:14.630
hands on experience whilst contributing back to the data science community.

07:14.630 --> 07:20.930
So enjoy spending some time on the chatbot arena, and I will see you next time to talk about commercial

07:20.930 --> 07:21.710
uses.
