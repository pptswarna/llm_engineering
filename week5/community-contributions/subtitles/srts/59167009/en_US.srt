WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:01.910
Welcome back.

00:01.910 --> 00:04.220
It's time to make our full agent framework.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.630
I'm super excited about this.

00:05.660 --> 00:10.490
It's pulling everything together that we've been doing before, and I think you'll be very happy with

00:10.490 --> 00:11.510
the outcome.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.730
Uh, so just a quick recap.

00:13.730 --> 00:14.870
An agent framework.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.840
The term agent I as I said, it's an umbrella term.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.120
It can refer to a bunch of different techniques.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.060
Um, for example, it can be any of these five.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.250
It can be about breaking a complex problem into smaller steps with multiple models carrying out different

00:28.250 --> 00:29.420
specialized tasks.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.890
It can be the ability for an LLM to have tools to give them extra capabilities.

00:33.890 --> 00:41.000
It can be, uh, talking about the agent environment, which is the setup or the agent framework that

00:41.000 --> 00:43.160
allows agents to collaborate.

00:43.190 --> 00:50.270
Um, it can be the idea that one LLM can act as a planner, dividing tasks into smaller ones, that

00:50.270 --> 00:55.100
specialists that can themselves be llms or bits of software can carry out.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.210
Um, and then there is another point here, which is that people talk about agentic AI when you're thinking

01:00.210 --> 01:07.740
about an agent having its own autonomy agency, uh, beyond necessarily just responding to a prompt,

01:07.740 --> 01:13.050
such as having memory, being able to sort of, uh, I don't know, do something like, uh, scrape

01:13.050 --> 01:18.690
the web for news information and using that to make decisions about buying or selling stocks, something

01:18.690 --> 01:19.110
like that.

01:19.110 --> 01:26.040
That is a kind of, uh, something that that exists outside the context of just say, a request response

01:26.040 --> 01:26.670
chat.

01:26.670 --> 01:32.100
So these are all the kinds of ways that that these are the kinds of things people are referring to when

01:32.100 --> 01:34.890
they talk about agentic AI and the use of agents.

01:34.890 --> 01:39.510
And what we're really doing here is we're talking about, uh, definitely number one and two there and

01:39.510 --> 01:42.210
to a certain extent, numbers three and five.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.090
But we're not we're not building an LLM that does the planning.

01:45.090 --> 01:47.280
That's not something we'll be doing in this session.

01:47.280 --> 01:55.710
So, uh, this should be somewhat familiar to you because this is the chat method that's quite close

01:55.710 --> 01:57.000
to what we had before.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.710
So you'll recognize a few things about this.

01:59.710 --> 02:07.210
This section here is the usual chat radio function that we know really well.

02:07.210 --> 02:16.180
It takes a message and a history, and it, uh, sort of unpacks that history into the format that OpenAI

02:16.210 --> 02:20.200
will expect and then calls the response.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.080
This part here will also look familiar to you because it's our use of tools.

02:26.080 --> 02:32.860
It's where we find out if the model wants to call a tool, and if so, we handle that tool.

02:33.010 --> 02:38.950
Uh, but there's one little extra line just inserted in there, and it's that line there that what we're

02:38.950 --> 02:44.710
going to say is if the person does, if the model decides it needs to, to run the tool to find the

02:44.710 --> 02:54.520
price of a ticket, then we will also have the, um, artist generate an image to represent that city

02:54.520 --> 02:56.200
that's being looked up.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.160
So there we have it.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.050
Uh, that's, uh that's nice.

03:00.050 --> 03:04.160
And also, now, if you remember before I told you there was a reason I passed back city that you're

03:04.160 --> 03:04.940
going to find out.

03:04.970 --> 03:05.690
Here it is.

03:05.690 --> 03:09.800
That's why I needed the city to pass it to the artist.

03:10.130 --> 03:13.880
Um, and then, uh, this is all exactly the same.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.040
There's one more tiny change.

03:16.040 --> 03:22.760
Which is this here, which is that, uh, once I've collected the response from the model, I then call

03:22.790 --> 03:26.840
talker to make sure that we speak the response.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.780
So that is our chat.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.270
Uh, let's run that.

03:33.920 --> 03:40.550
Now, this, I should say, since I've always showed off about how easy Gradio is, this code is a little

03:40.580 --> 03:41.420
bit more involved.

03:41.420 --> 03:46.970
You may notice the reason is because we're now because we want to do a little bit more and show images.

03:46.970 --> 03:55.190
We're going outside the default, the sort of off the shelf, uh, chat user interface that Gradio provides

03:55.190 --> 03:55.550
for us.

03:55.550 --> 03:58.120
And we have to then build the interface ourselves.

03:58.150 --> 04:04.960
And as a result, I've had to put together this interface that kind of puts together the various components

04:04.960 --> 04:07.090
like the input and the buttons.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.180
But what I'll say is this is still actually super straightforward.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.470
It still reads like English.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.030
It's very clear what's going on.

04:13.030 --> 04:19.330
You'll see everything that's happening here, and hopefully this will be quite readable for you.

04:19.330 --> 04:26.740
And you can use this to build more sophisticated chats, more sophisticated UIs yourself.

04:26.740 --> 04:36.850
So with that background, we now are going to run this to it's running and we'll bring that up.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.650
And here we have our chat with our new assistant.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.300
Let's give it a try.

04:47.740 --> 04:48.280
Hello.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.630
How can I assist you today.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.090
You like that?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.650
It spoke to us.

04:53.740 --> 04:54.520
There we go.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.620
That's the first use of an agent.

04:56.620 --> 05:04.420
We had a specialist model that's able to create, uh, audio, and we integrated that with our chatbot

05:04.420 --> 05:07.510
so that it was able to speak back to us.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.020
Great choice.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.410
Would you like to know the to the ticket price for a return trip to London?

05:22.930 --> 05:24.220
There we go.

05:24.250 --> 05:27.220
That's entertaining, let's say.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.710
We know there's a pause.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.080
Here we go.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.220
A return ticket to London is priced at 799.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.920
And there we have it.

05:54.950 --> 05:58.340
A return ticket to London is priced at $7.99.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.290
And there is the image.

06:00.290 --> 06:04.220
And that image looks spectacular.

06:04.370 --> 06:06.290
A London bus in the middle.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.700
It's got Big Ben.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.400
It's got the bridge.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.690
It's got, uh.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.420
Yeah, I can see taxi there.

06:14.450 --> 06:18.950
It's just a great montage of images.

06:19.160 --> 06:26.570
Uh, and so I find this to be very compelling indeed, a wonderful example of what we're able to achieve

06:26.570 --> 06:28.280
with just a little bit of code.

06:28.520 --> 06:37.550
And so I present to you a multimodal app, complete with audio and some images running as part of what

06:37.550 --> 06:48.050
is a in a, in a small way, a multimodal agentic framework for talking to an airline AI assistant.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.280
Great work.

06:49.310 --> 06:52.790
I'll see you for the challenge of the week and the wrap up.
