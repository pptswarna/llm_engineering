00:00.110 --> 00:05.630
Welcome back to Jupyter Lab, where I want to show you the assignment, the homework exercise for you

00:05.630 --> 00:09.170
for the end of week one, coming into the week one folder.

00:09.170 --> 00:14.330
And you'll see here week one exercise so you can see there's rather little here.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.550
There's a little framework to tell you what we're doing.

00:16.550 --> 00:23.150
So the idea is for you to build a little tool that will be used by yourself as something that can be

00:23.150 --> 00:25.130
your guide during this course.

00:25.160 --> 00:33.170
It's going to be a tool which will be able to answer questions on code, on llms, on things that you

00:33.170 --> 00:39.290
might run into along the way and be your sidekick, your your customized copilot for this experience.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.120
And this is what it's going to do.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.300
Uh, it's going to you're going to fill in some inputs.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.840
You're going to you can just use these two constants we've got here.

00:47.840 --> 00:55.790
You're going to be using both GPT and open source llama running in llama on your computer, something

00:55.790 --> 01:00.140
which you're familiar with from our week two assignment or day two assignment.

01:00.170 --> 01:03.300
You'll put some code in here to set up your environment.

01:03.360 --> 01:09.780
And then this is where you will type the question that you want to ask your tutor, your personal private

01:09.780 --> 01:10.500
tutor.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.330
And in this case, I am asking it to explain what this code does and why.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.340
And this again, is that line of code that we looked at a couple of times, which is has a few different

01:20.340 --> 01:24.270
things going on there, and this is the better version of the code than the one I originally wrote.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.370
This is the version that I think it was.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.230
Yeah, it was GPT four with canvas that wrote this version of it.

01:31.500 --> 01:39.450
So we will provide this, and then you will fill in this piece of code here, which will get GPT four

01:39.450 --> 01:40.530
mini to answer.

01:40.530 --> 01:47.310
And you should try and answer and have that response stream back and use markdown, uh, so that it

01:47.310 --> 01:49.560
appears in full glory.

01:49.620 --> 01:55.620
Uh, and then do the same thing again for llama 3.2 and see the answer there.

01:55.620 --> 02:00.090
So this will need you to to write the code from scratch and sort of type it out.

02:00.090 --> 02:06.460
And of course you should look back at the fragments of code that we came up with on the prior days and

02:06.460 --> 02:12.010
used that to build this, and hopefully it will be something that will come reasonably naturally and

02:12.010 --> 02:16.360
you'll be used to the familiar .0., blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.390
It's all going to be something that will be in your memory and you'll also be very comfortable, I hope,

02:22.390 --> 02:28.120
with creating the messages list of dictionaries, something that you're used to at this point.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.600
Um, and when you do that, you'll see what answer that you get for this.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.750
And it's actually a remarkably good answer.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.850
Again, I think much better than I could do.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.010
Uh, and it would be interesting to see whether you're also happy with the answer that you get from

02:42.010 --> 02:46.000
a minuscule model that is much, much smaller by comparison.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.950
And see how you compare those two.

02:47.980 --> 02:52.480
And then in the future, you'll be able to use this as a bit of a resource.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.450
And so I hope this this is useful for you.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.740
And in fact, after week two, you might want to come back to this and add a user interface to it.

02:59.740 --> 03:04.450
So you could have like a little tool running on the side that would be uh, could be super handy.

03:04.630 --> 03:09.650
Uh, one also thing that you might do is that what I've done here is I've just put down the question

03:09.650 --> 03:11.060
as a global variable.

03:11.060 --> 03:15.350
You might instead want to see if you can think about a way that you could take that in as an input and

03:15.350 --> 03:16.880
be a bit more dynamic about this.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.890
So it could just be a cell that you run, but maybe do that as a as a later improvement.

03:22.430 --> 03:28.910
Now I've done this and the solution is sitting in this solutions folder, but I urge you not to look

03:28.940 --> 03:29.840
at the solution.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.350
Uh, not not unless you you find yourself feeling stuck.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.730
There's nothing worse than feeling stuck.

03:34.760 --> 03:41.870
If you do feel stuck, you could always try first asking ChatGPT or Claude for a nudge, but otherwise,

03:41.870 --> 03:43.790
please, please, please reach out to me.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.190
There is no reason whatsoever to be stuck with this.

03:46.220 --> 03:49.160
It should be something that you that you're able to to get through.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.750
And I would love to help you with that.

03:50.750 --> 03:57.710
Get you to a point when you have your own personal, technical and data science tutor to help you along

03:57.710 --> 03:58.190
the way.

03:58.190 --> 04:06.560
So, um, above all, be sure to have fun with this and I will see you back for the wrap up video for

04:06.560 --> 04:07.220
week one.
