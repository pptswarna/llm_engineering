00:00.080 --> 00:07.220
Well, that's a fantastic result to have now arrived towards the end of week one and having completed

00:07.250 --> 00:09.980
a substantial and exciting project.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.350
Now, of course, there are some challenges for you.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.000
This is where it gets interesting.

00:14.030 --> 00:18.860
First of all, I have some challenges, which is things that you can do to make this project better,

00:18.860 --> 00:20.990
similar to things I just mentioned a moment ago.

00:20.990 --> 00:27.350
And then after that there is an exercise, a proper work through homework assignment for you where you

00:27.350 --> 00:29.180
have to build something from scratch.

00:29.180 --> 00:33.230
And of course, I do provide a solution when you're ready for it, but I don't think you'll need it

00:33.230 --> 00:34.610
because I think you got this.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.230
Let's start with the challenges.

00:36.230 --> 00:42.650
So first of all, uh, in the when we built the the brochure maker that we've already got, there are,

00:42.680 --> 00:44.600
of course, the two calls to the LMS.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.840
The first call I described as one shot prompting because we give an example of some JSON of how it should

00:50.840 --> 00:51.830
reply.

00:51.860 --> 00:57.530
And now I mentioned before that there's also this expression multi-shot prompting, which is when you

00:57.530 --> 01:00.110
provide multiple examples.

01:00.110 --> 01:05.090
And so that's what I would like you to do, extend this to have multi shot prompting and really to make

01:05.090 --> 01:06.350
it true multi-shot prompting.

01:06.350 --> 01:12.770
The way you would do is you'd say something like, so if I show you these links, you might reply like

01:12.770 --> 01:19.670
this and give it some JSON, clearly indicating where you've only selected the relevant links and how

01:19.670 --> 01:21.650
you fully qualified the path.

01:21.650 --> 01:22.880
So try doing that.

01:22.880 --> 01:29.090
Put in 1 or 2 more examples, because that will be then making use of Multi-shot prompting.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.610
And you can add that to your resume that you've done multi-shot prompting.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.920
I joke, of course, but but it is an important skill to have done and tried.

01:36.920 --> 01:43.700
But the reason it's useful is that when you do this, you improve the quality and reliability of the

01:43.700 --> 01:44.900
call to the LLM.

01:44.930 --> 01:53.870
Adding more uh, examples into the prompt strengthens the its, its ability to reliably predict the

01:53.870 --> 01:56.480
next tokens and what you want it to be predicting.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.940
So this is a good exercise to do.

01:58.940 --> 02:03.500
It's a good way to add more robustness to this LLM call.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.690
And it's something that we'll be doing along the course.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.810
And it's something that you'll want to incorporate in your own projects.

02:08.810 --> 02:13.570
So please do give that a try and say give that a shot, give that a multi shot.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.700
So and I also I mentioned that towards the end of the course we're going to be using this technique

02:18.700 --> 02:20.050
called structured outputs.

02:20.050 --> 02:23.620
That actually forces the LLM to respond in a particular way.

02:23.620 --> 02:30.160
But still Multi-shot prompting helps giving it that extra context that that extra sort of flavor for

02:30.160 --> 02:31.330
what you're looking for.

02:32.050 --> 02:37.000
Um, and then just things you can do for the second call to generate the brochure.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.350
We already talked, of course, about using the system prompts to make it be snarky or sarcastic or

02:41.350 --> 02:41.740
whatever.

02:41.740 --> 02:46.900
And I mentioned that you can use the system prompt to make it generate something in a different language,

02:46.990 --> 02:48.010
like Spanish.

02:48.010 --> 02:53.290
There's another thing you could do there which might be more, certainly more interesting.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.450
I don't know if it will get you a better result or not.

02:55.450 --> 03:00.880
And that would be generate the brochure in English and then make a second call.

03:01.030 --> 03:08.080
Actually, of course, it's a third call to the LLM to translate the brochure from English to Spanish.

03:08.140 --> 03:14.020
Uh, now, in many ways it's probably actually not going to be any better to do it that way in this

03:14.020 --> 03:14.710
case.

03:14.710 --> 03:20.080
But by getting into that practice of doing that, you could imagine that we might use a model that is

03:20.080 --> 03:26.440
actually specially trained for the purposes of translation, and so you could use that model just for

03:26.470 --> 03:31.900
that purpose, and that would then allow you for sure to get a better outcome using one model that's

03:31.900 --> 03:36.730
trained for brochure generation and a different model that's trained for translation.

03:36.730 --> 03:41.950
And so whilst we will in fact probably be using just GPT four or mini for both purposes, it certainly

03:41.950 --> 03:45.970
gives you that hands on experience of making the multiple calls.

03:45.970 --> 03:50.350
And again, that's basically a miniature implementation of Agentic AI.

03:50.380 --> 03:55.900
So again, great thing to get into the habit of doing, even if you could probably just use the system

03:55.900 --> 03:58.210
prompt to do it all in 1 in 1 bash.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.370
Anyway, those are the things to do.

04:00.370 --> 04:08.680
This will really help build your your confidence and your experience with these kinds of techniques,

04:08.710 --> 04:12.970
which will come in extremely useful in the upcoming weeks.

04:12.970 --> 04:18.130
And then I have an exercise for you, and this is where you'll be building something from scratch.

04:18.130 --> 04:22.030
And to show you that, I will take you to the next video back to JupyterLab.
