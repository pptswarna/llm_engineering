00:00.020 --> 00:04.280
In this video, we're going to set up a full data science environment for Mac users.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.110
In the next video, we'll do PC users.

00:06.110 --> 00:09.080
So if you're a PC person, please skip to the next.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.200
You can you can listen in here if you wish, but otherwise I will see you next time.

00:12.290 --> 00:16.310
Okay, so my Mac people now I'm a mac person myself.

00:16.310 --> 00:19.520
I've always owned Macs, so you are my home crowd.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.740
You are definitely my favorites.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.050
It's not like I'm going to say the same thing to the other guys.

00:24.080 --> 00:24.950
Or maybe I am.

00:24.950 --> 00:33.830
Anyways, this is looking right now in a Chrome browser at the repo LM engineering in GitHub, and this

00:33.830 --> 00:39.440
link should hopefully be plastered all over the place, including in the lecture notes for this lecture.

00:39.530 --> 00:45.170
Uh, but please come here and look at the GitHub repo, uh, to see the code that we have.

00:45.170 --> 00:49.520
Uh, what you'll also see if you scroll down is the contents of the Readme file, which is where I have

00:49.520 --> 00:51.890
laid out what needs to be done to set up your environment.

00:51.890 --> 00:57.500
And I hope that I've done a decent job here of laying things out step by step and being clear on what

00:57.530 --> 00:59.750
action to take, if anything is to go wrong.

00:59.790 --> 01:04.200
so hopefully it's good, but if you have any corrections to make to it.

01:04.410 --> 01:09.360
As some people already have, for which I'm very grateful, please do let me know and I'll do that.

01:09.390 --> 01:09.960
Okay.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.470
But for now, what you're going to do is press this green button here code.

01:13.470 --> 01:16.230
And then you can pick either of these two.

01:16.260 --> 01:21.990
But you're going to pick this copy button here, which is going to copy the URL that identifies this

01:21.990 --> 01:23.520
repo into the clipboard.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.990
And that is done.

01:25.020 --> 01:25.680
All right.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.500
We're now going to bring up a terminal window where we're going to go next.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.030
Now this some of this you can do using the max finder windows if you prefer that.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.930
But I'm more comfortable in terminals and I imagine many of you are too.

01:37.170 --> 01:39.300
So I'm now in my home directory.

01:39.330 --> 01:45.150
Many of you will have a projects directory set up, which is where you manage your your projects.

01:45.180 --> 01:46.860
At the moment I don't have one set up.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.810
If I do CD projects, there's nothing there.

01:48.810 --> 01:53.220
So I'm going to make a directory projects and go into it.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.750
Here we go.

01:55.050 --> 01:59.330
And then the next thing I'm going to do when I'm inside the projects folder is I'm going to type git

01:59.330 --> 02:05.540
clone, I want to clone a repo and paste in the name of the repo right there, and when I press enter,

02:05.540 --> 02:06.770
it does its thing.

02:06.770 --> 02:10.670
And I now have locally an LM engineering folder.

02:10.700 --> 02:14.000
I'm going to go into it and there is all of our code.

02:14.150 --> 02:19.580
It's worth pointing out that where we are right now in the LM engineering folder is what people sometimes

02:19.580 --> 02:22.850
call being in the project root directory.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.940
That's, that's the name for for where we are right now for this project.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.610
The project root directory LM engineering.

02:28.670 --> 02:29.540
All right.

02:29.540 --> 02:33.890
So the next thing to do is for us to look at installing Anaconda.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.630
If you haven't installed it before.

02:35.630 --> 02:42.350
And the Readme has a direct link to the installation page at anaconda.com, which will allow you to

02:42.380 --> 02:44.420
set it up for Mac OS.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.530
There's a simple set of screens that will go through and configure it.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.270
I'm not going to do it because I've already done it for me.

02:50.270 --> 02:54.680
But but it is very clearly step by step as you will see it here.

02:54.680 --> 03:01.010
And before you know it, you'll have Anaconda on your box when you have anaconda on your box.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.750
Back to the terminal window.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.560
Here we are.

03:03.590 --> 03:09.650
We simply call a command that tells Anaconda to do everything to build a whole data science environment

03:09.650 --> 03:18.080
for us, and that command is conda env for environment create minus f, which means we're going to specify

03:18.080 --> 03:21.260
a file which has the full description of the environment.

03:21.260 --> 03:26.630
And that name of that file is environment.yml which you can see right here.

03:26.630 --> 03:29.630
That is the file that defines this environment.

03:29.630 --> 03:32.210
And when you've done that you press enter.

03:32.690 --> 03:40.220
Now what's going to happen now is that Anaconda is going to connect to its server, find out everything

03:40.220 --> 03:41.090
that we need to do.

03:41.090 --> 03:46.610
And it does what it's called solving environment, which means it figures out what versions of each

03:46.610 --> 03:52.970
of the different packages we need are going to be the right versions, that we need to have a fully

03:52.970 --> 03:55.400
compatible, full specked environment.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.780
And what you saw it just doing there with all of that stuff going on.

03:58.780 --> 04:05.590
Uh, was it, uh, feverishly creating the various, downloading the various packages and building them?

04:05.620 --> 04:09.400
Now, that might take a fair bit longer for you, because it's fast for me, because I've already done

04:09.400 --> 04:13.000
it and it's cached locally the first time it needs to download it.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.300
For me, I have a pretty good internet connection, and it took about five minutes.

04:16.300 --> 04:21.760
The first time I did this, someone reported that it was taking more than 20 minutes for them.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.510
Uh, which is of course, uh, yeah, a lot of time to wait.

04:25.510 --> 04:30.940
So if it's taking that long, then that might be if you have a slower internet connection that might

04:30.940 --> 04:31.690
be expected.

04:31.690 --> 04:36.370
But if it takes much longer than 20 minutes and you have a good internet connection, then something's

04:36.370 --> 04:37.660
not working with Anaconda.

04:37.660 --> 04:43.900
And I would cancel it with command C, and instead we'll use the other approach, the virtual environment

04:43.900 --> 04:45.280
approach instead.

04:45.550 --> 04:52.540
So right now, Anaconda is busy doing what it calls executing the transaction, which is essentially

04:52.660 --> 04:58.090
after it's figured out what versions of what we need, It's building that that whole environment.

04:58.090 --> 05:02.560
And then at the end, for those that know about this, there are also some packages that I pip install

05:02.590 --> 05:05.980
because they're not they don't yet have conda versions.

05:06.130 --> 05:09.940
So there are some packages that get pip installed at the end of it.

05:09.940 --> 05:14.500
But when you see installing pip install you are near the very end and it's done.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.550
So I didn't lie.

05:15.550 --> 05:17.500
It doesn't need to take a long amount of time.

05:17.530 --> 05:21.340
It's pretty fast and all of that is done.

05:21.490 --> 05:28.600
We need to activate our new environment, which means we need to say we want that to be the live environment

05:28.600 --> 05:30.190
that's currently being used.

05:30.220 --> 05:35.470
If you look at my my cursor right now, you'll see the word base is to the left here.

05:35.470 --> 05:40.810
And that means that we're not currently running in an in an anaconda environment right at the moment.

05:40.810 --> 05:48.010
In order to use our LM environment, we the name of the environment is LMS and we're going to type conda

05:48.130 --> 05:51.460
activate LMS.

05:51.460 --> 05:57.790
And that is all it takes to tell Anaconda we want to be running in this environment with the same version

05:57.790 --> 06:01.150
of Python, the same version of all of these packages?

06:01.150 --> 06:03.580
That means that we are completely consistent.

06:03.580 --> 06:07.600
That happened immediately, and you'll see that LMS is now written on the left.

06:07.600 --> 06:13.540
And if you're seeing that, that is your clue that it's worked and that you are now running the right

06:13.540 --> 06:14.950
version of Anaconda.

06:16.180 --> 06:20.800
And as a final step here, I type in this command JupyterLab.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.620
And JupyterLab is the command that says, I want to launch this data science environment called JupyterLab,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.830
which allows me to work very interactively with code.

06:29.830 --> 06:35.710
And when I run that, it thinks for hopefully just a moment while it considers the task at hand.

06:35.710 --> 06:39.550
And then it will launch JupyterLab in a new screen.

06:39.550 --> 06:42.850
And what you will probably see is something a bit like this.

06:43.270 --> 06:43.930
All right.

06:43.930 --> 06:47.380
With that, I'm now going to pause for you guys.

06:47.380 --> 06:53.710
I'm going to record a video for the PC users, and I'll meet you back in two videos time.

06:53.740 --> 06:54.610
See you there.
