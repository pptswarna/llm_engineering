00:00.830 --> 00:01.970
It's remarkable.

00:01.970 --> 00:04.970
But you are now at the 95% point.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.820
There's 5% remaining of this course.

00:07.880 --> 00:13.850
Uh, maybe it's not remarkable because hopefully you're feeling like you've built up such strong skills

00:13.850 --> 00:15.800
and you're getting really experienced.

00:15.830 --> 00:21.050
You probably saw some of the problems I was having a moment ago, before I did, and knew exactly how

00:21.050 --> 00:22.010
to sort them out.

00:22.010 --> 00:25.880
So what you can now do is this long list of things.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.150
I could no longer fit it into three bullets, and I struggled to fit it into four.

00:29.180 --> 00:30.590
There's far too much stuff.

00:30.590 --> 00:35.660
I had to put structured outputs in here in the first bullet, just to try and fit it in, but there's

00:35.660 --> 00:41.090
so much that you can do across closed source and open source models, calling them in all sorts of ways

00:41.090 --> 00:43.700
now, including productionizing them.

00:43.850 --> 00:50.990
Uh, and now we change topic to talk about agent workflows Agentic frameworks.

00:51.110 --> 00:55.100
This is something that we touched on in previous weeks.

00:55.100 --> 01:00.380
Uh, we, we had, we used uh, function calling, which we said at the time is a kind of light version

01:00.380 --> 01:07.370
of, of agent workflows where you do have, um, a task that's being divided into smaller tasks with

01:07.370 --> 01:10.430
specific models carrying out tasks.

01:10.430 --> 01:15.350
And as you take that up a notch and start to get to an environment like we've been talking about this

01:15.350 --> 01:20.660
week, where you have multiple models that are all working independently, potentially being organized

01:20.660 --> 01:27.170
by a planning task, a planning agent, and then put together in some sort of a framework which has

01:27.170 --> 01:34.340
memory and which can, uh, live beyond outside the context of a human necessarily interacting with

01:34.340 --> 01:34.670
it.

01:34.700 --> 01:41.960
You're getting to a full on agentic workflow, and that is what we will be talking about next time.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.310
And I'm really excited about it.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.540
And I will see you then.
