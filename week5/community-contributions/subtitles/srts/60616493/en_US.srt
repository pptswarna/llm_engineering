00:00.050 --> 00:04.430
I'll just take a quick moment to introduce myself to convince you that I am actually qualified to be

00:04.430 --> 00:05.960
taking you on this eight week journey.

00:05.990 --> 00:07.730
So my name is Ed Donner.

00:07.760 --> 00:13.400
I've got about 20 years of experience in software engineering, data science, and tech leadership.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.710
Most of my career at JP Morgan, where at the end I ran engineering teams of about 300 people.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.050
I started out in London where I'm from.

00:21.110 --> 00:26.000
I then moved to Tokyo for a bit and ended up in New York City, where I live now.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.720
After JP Morgan, I founded a couple of AI startups.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.720
My first startup was sold, was acquired a couple of years ago, and in fact, that picture on the bottom

00:35.720 --> 00:41.720
right shows the moment when it was announced on a Times Square billboard.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.720
That was a particularly magical moment for me.

00:44.720 --> 00:50.870
But I don't want to show you that photo to brag about my Times Square moment, but also because, curiously,

00:50.870 --> 00:53.030
I actually live very near Times Square.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.410
It's an unusual place to live because it's such a sort of tourist place to be.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.810
But if you see these two red arrows and you imagine where they join up, that's basically where I live.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.450
And that's where I am right now.

01:04.660 --> 01:09.250
And so if you can imagine if I wave at you right now, if this were somehow a real time photo, you'd

01:09.250 --> 01:13.120
have a little me waving at you from roundabout where those red lines meet.

01:13.600 --> 01:13.930
Okay.

01:13.960 --> 01:19.960
And the final thing to mention, the picture in the middle at the bottom shows me flying.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.430
Or in front of a plane.

01:21.430 --> 01:25.300
You might be thinking, that's me saying, this is my big passion, my hobby, I fly planes.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.030
But in fact, that's that's not not what I was going to say.

01:28.090 --> 01:34.000
It turns out that whilst I'm very proficient and highly skilled in the field of llms, that does not

01:34.000 --> 01:40.300
translate in any way to my hand-eye coordination, which is terrible on almost any front, including

01:40.300 --> 01:44.620
flying planes where I have tried and am very shaky to say the least.

01:44.650 --> 01:50.230
So if it turns out that you find yourself in a plane and you look at the cockpit and you see that I

01:50.230 --> 01:54.370
am the person there on the stick, I suggest you look quickly for the nearest parachute.

01:54.610 --> 02:01.120
But if it comes to you needing to go on an eight week course to build up commercial expertise in how

02:01.120 --> 02:04.750
to be an LM engineer, then you've come to the right place.

02:04.780 --> 02:07.750
All right, without further ado, let's get to the course.
