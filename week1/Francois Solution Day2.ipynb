       "\n",
       "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Types of Machine Learning**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled data and makes predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
       "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm identifies patterns and structure in unlabeled data.\n",
       "3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where some data is labeled and some is not.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Machine Learning Algorithms**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Classification**: Predicting a categorical label for a new instance (e.g., spam vs. non-spam email).\n",
       "2. **Regression**: Predicting a continuous value for a new instance (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like number of rooms and square footage).\n",
       "3. **Clustering**: Grouping similar instances into clusters.\n",
       "4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in a dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Reinforcement Learning**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: An environment with a set of states, actions, and rewards.\n",
       "2. **Agent**: An entity that interacts with the environment to maximize rewards.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Applications of Machine Learning**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Image Classification**: Classifying images into categories (e.g., self-driving cars).\n",
       "2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzing and generating human language (e.g., chatbots, text summarization).\n",
       "3. **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products or services based on user behavior.\n",
       "4. **Speech Recognition**: Transcribing spoken words into text.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Concepts**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balancing the tradeoff between model simplicity and accuracy.\n",
       "2. **Overfitting**: When a model is too complex and fits the training data but fails to generalize to new data.\n",
       "3. **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple and fails to capture important patterns in the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Computational Learning Theory**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning**: A framework for analyzing the performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",
